<span>'If thou indeed derive thy light from Heaven,<br /></span>
<span>Then to the measure of that heaven-born light,<br /></span>
<span>Shine, POET, in thy place, and be content:'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Like an untended watch-fire,' &amp;c. (l. 10): These Verses were written
some time after we had become resident at Rydal Mount; and I will take
occasion from them to observe upon the beauty of that situation, as
being backed and flanked by lofty fells, which bring the heavenly bodies
to touch, as it were, the earth upon the mountain-tops, while the
prospect in front lies open to a length of level valley, the extended
lake, and a terminating ridge of low hills; so that it gives an
opportunity to the inhabitants of the place of noticing the stars in
both the positions here alluded to, namely, on the tops of the
mountains, and as winter-lamps at a distance among the leafless trees.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem2" id="poem2" ></a>2. *<i>Prelude to the Last Volume</i>. [As supra.]</h3>

<p>These Verses were begun while I was on a visit to my son John at
Brigham, and finished at Rydal. As the contents of this Volume to which
they are now prefixed will be assigned to their respective classes when
my Poems shall be collected in one Vol., I should be at a loss where
with propriety to place this Prelude, being too restricted in its
bearing to serve as a Preface for the whole. The lines towards the
conclusion allude to the discontents then fomented thro' the country by
the Agitators of the Anti-Corn-Law League: the particular causes of such
troubles are transitory, but disposition to excite and liability to be
excited, are nevertheless permanent and therefore proper objects of the
Poet's regard.</p>

<h3><a name="poem3" id="poem3" ></a>3. *<i>Extract from the Conclusion of a Poem, composed in anticipation
of leaving School. [I.]</i></h3>

<p>'Dear native regions,' &amp;c. 1786. Hawkshead. The beautiful image with
which this poem concludes suggested itself to me while I was resting in
a boat along with my companions under the shade of a magnificent row of
sycamores, which then extended their branches from the shore of the
promontory upon which stands the ancient and at that time the more
picturesque Hall of Coniston, the Seat of the Le Flemings from very
early times. The Poem of which it was the conclusion was of many hundred
lines, and contained thoughts and images most of which have been
dispersed through my other writings.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem4" id="poem4" ></a>4. Of the Poems in this class, 'The Evening Walk' and 'Descriptive
Sketches' were first published in 1793.  They are reprinted with some alterations
that were chiefly made very soon after their publication.</h3>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This notice, which was written some time ago, scarcely applies to the
Poem, 'Descriptive Sketches,' as it now stands. The corrections, though
numerous, are not, however, such as to prevent its retaining with
propriety a place in the class of Juvenile Pieces.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem5" id="poem5" ></a>5. *<i>An Evening Walk. Addressed to a Young Lady</i>. [III.]</h3>

<p>The young lady to whom this was addressed was my sister. It was composed
at School and during my first two college vacations. There is not an
image in it which I have not observed; and, now in my seventy-third
year, I recollect the time and place where most of them were noticed. I
will confine myself to one instance.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Waving his hat, the shepherd from the vale<br /></span>
<span>Directs his wandering dog the cliffs to scale;<br /></span>
<span>The dog bounds barking mid the glittering rocks,<br /></span>
<span>Hunts where his master points, the intercepted flocks.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I was an eye-witness of this for the first time while crossing the pass
of Dunmail Raise. Upon second thought, I will mention another image:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>{5}</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'And fronting the bright west, yon oak entwines<br /></span>
<span>Its darkening boughs and leaves in stronger lines.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is feebly and imperfectly exprest; but I recollect distinctly the
very spot where this first struck me. It was on the way between
Hawkshead and Ambleside, and gave me extreme pleasure. The moment was
important in my poetical history; for I date from it my consciousness of
the infinite variety of natural appearances which had been unnoticed by
the poets of any age or country, so far as I was acquainted with them;
and I made a resolution to supply in some degree the deficiency. I could
not have been at that time above fourteen years of age. The description
of the swans that follows, was taken from the daily opportunities I had
of observing their habits, not as confined to the gentleman's park, but
in a state of nature. There were two pairs of them that divided the lake
of Esthwaite and its in-and-out-flowing streams between them, never
trespassing a single yard upon each other's separate domain. They were
of the old magnificent species, bearing in beauty and majesty about the
same relation to the Thames swan which that does to a goose. It was from
the remembrance of these noble creatures I took, thirty years after, the
picture of the swan which I have discarded from the poem of 'Dion.'
While I was a school-boy, the late Mr. Curwen introduced a little fleet
of these birds, but of the inferior species, to the Lake of Windermere.
Their principal home was about his own islands; but they sailed about
into remote parts of the lake, and either from real or imagined injury
done to the adjoining fields, they were got rid of at the request of the
farmers and proprietors, but to the great regret of all who had become
attached to them from noticing their beauty and quiet habits. I will
conclude my notice of this poem by observing that the plan of it has not
been confined to a particular walk, or an individual place; a proof (of
which I was unconscious at the time) of my unwillingness to submit the
poetic spirit to the chains of fact and real circumstance. The country
is idealized rather than described in any one of its local aspects.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">DEDICATION.</span>
<span>TO THE REV. ROBERT JONES, FELLOW OF ST. JOHN'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.</span>
</div></div>

<p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;However desirous I might have been of giving you proofs of
the high place you hold in my esteem, I should have been cautious of
wounding your delicacy by thus publicly addressing you, had not the
circumstance of our having been companions among the Alps seemed to give
this dedication a propriety sufficient to do away any scruples which
your modesty might otherwise have suggested.</p>

<p>In inscribing this little work to you, I consult my heart. You know well
how great is the difference between two companions lolling in a
post-chaise, and two travellers plodding slowly along the road, side by
side, each with his little knapsack of necessaries upon his shoulders.
How much more of heart between the two latter!</p>

<p>I am happy in being conscious that I shall have one reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>{7}</span> who will
approach the conclusion of these few pages with regret. You they must
certainly interest, in reminding you of moments to which you can hardly
look back without a pleasure not the less dear from a shade of
melancholy. You will meet with few images without recollecting the spot
where we observed them together; consequently, whatever is feeble in my
design, or spiritless in my colouring, will be amply supplied by your
own memory.</p>

<p>With still greater propriety I might have inscribed to you a description
of some of the features of your native mountains, through which we have
wandered together, in the same manner, with so much pleasure. But the
sea-sunsets, which give such splendour to the vale of Clwyd, Snowdon,
the chair of Idris, the quiet village of Bethgelert, Menai and her
Druids, the Alpine steeps of the Conway, and the still more interesting
windings of the wizard stream of the Dee, remain yet untouched.
Apprehensive that my pencil may never be exercised on these subjects, I
cannot let slip this opportunity of thus publicly assuring you with how
much affection and esteem</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">I am, dear Sir,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Most sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">W. WORDSWORTH.</span><br />

<p>London, 1793.</p>

<h3><a name="poem10" id="poem10" ></a>10. *<i>Descriptive Sketches</i>.</h3>

<p>1791-2. Much the greatest part of this poem was composed during my walks
upon the banks of the Loire, in the years 1791, 1792. I will only notice
that the description of the valley filled with mist, beginning 'In
solemn shapes,' &amp;c. was taken from that beautiful region, of which the
principal features are Lungarn and Sarnen. Nothing that I ever saw in
Nature left a more delightful impression on my mind than that which I
have attempted, alas how feebly! to convey to others in these lines.
Those two lakes have always interested me, especially from bearing, in
their size and other features, a resemblance to those of the North of
England. It is much to be deplored that a district so beautiful should
be so unhealthy as it is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>{8}</span></p>

commanding a beautiful Prospect. [VII.]</i></h3>

<p>Composed in part at school at Hawkshead. The tree has disappeared, and
the slip of Common on which it stood, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>{9}</span> ran parallel to the lake,
and lay open to it, has long been enclosed, so that the road has lost
much of its attraction. This spot was my favourite walk in the evenings
during the latter part of my school-time. The individual whose habits
and character are here given was a gentleman of the neighbourhood, a man
of talent and learning, who had been educated at one of our
universities, and returned to pass his time in seclusion on his own
estate. He died a bachelor in middle age. Induced by the beauty of the
prospect, he built a small summer-house on the rocks above the peninsula
on which the ferry-house stands. [In pencil here&mdash;Query, Mr. Nott?]</p>

<p>This property afterwards past into the hands of the late Mr. Curwen. The
site was long ago pointed out by Mr. West in his <i>Guide</i> as the pride of
the Lakes, and now goes by the name of 'The Station.' So much used I to
be delighted with the view from it, while a little boy, that some years
before the first pleasure-house was built, I led thither from Hawkshead
a youngster about my own age, an Irish boy, who was a servant to an
itinerant conjuror. My motive was to witness the pleasure I expected the
boy would receive from the prospect of the islands below, and the
intermingling water. I was not disappointed; and I hope the fact,
insignificant as it may seem to some, may be thought worthy of note by
others who may cast their eye over these notes.</p>

<h3><a name="poem19" id="poem19" ></a>19. <i>Guilt and Sorrow; or Incidents upon Salisbury Plain</i>.[VIII.]</h3>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">ADVERTISEMENT, PREFIXED TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS POEM, PUBLISHED IN
1842.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Not less than one-third of the following poem, though it has from time
to time been altered in the expression, was published so far back as the
year 1798, under the title of 'The Female Vagrant.' The extract is of
such length that an apology seems to be required for reprinting it here:
but it was necessary to restore it to its original position, or the rest
would have been unintelligible. The whole was written before the close
of the year 1794, and I will detail, rather as a matter of literary
biography than for any other reason, the circumstances under which it
was produced.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the summer of 1793, having passed a month in
the Isle of Wight, in view of the fleet which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>{10}</span> then preparing for
sea off Portsmouth at the commencement of the war, I left the place with
melancholy forebodings. The American war was still fresh in memory. The
struggle which was beginning, and which many thought would be brought to
a speedy close by the irresistible arms of Great Britain being added to
those of the Allies, I was assured in my own mind would be of long
continuance, and productive of distress and misery beyond all possible
calculation. This conviction was pressed upon me by having been a
witness, during a long residence in revolutionary France, of the spirit
which prevailed in that country. After leaving the Isle of Wight, I
spent two days in wandering on foot over Salisbury Plain, which, though
cultivation was then widely spread through parts of it, had upon the
whole a still more impressive appearance than it now retains.</p>

<p>The monuments and traces of antiquity, scattered in abundance over that
region, led me unavoidably to compare what we know or guess of those
remote times with certain aspects of modern society, and with
calamities, principally those consequent upon war, to which, more than
other classes of men, the poor are subject. In those reflections, joined
with particular facts that had come to my knowledge, the following
stanzas originated.</p>

<p>In conclusion, to obviate some distraction in the minds of those who are
well acquainted with Salisbury Plain, it may be proper to say, that of
the features described as belonging to it, one or two are taken from
other desolate parts of England.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem20" id="poem20" ></a>20. *<i>The Female Vagrant</i>.</h3>

<p>I find the date of this is placed in 1792 in contradiction, by mistake,
to what I have asserted in 'Guilt and Sorrow.' The correct date is
1793-4. The chief incidents of it, more particularly her description of
her feelings on the Atlantic, are taken from life.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem21" id="poem21" ></a>21. *<i>Guilt and Sorrow; or Incidents upon Salisbury Plain</i>. [VIII.]</h3>

<p>Unwilling to be unnecessarily particular, I have assigned this poem to
the dates 1793 and 1794; but, in fact, much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>{11}</span> the Female Vagrant's
story was composed at least two years before. All that relates to her
sufferings as a soldier's wife in America, and her condition of mind
during her voyage home, were faithfully taken from the report made to me
of her own case by a friend who had been subjected to the same trials,
and affected in the same way. Mr. Coleridge, when I first became
acquainted with him, was so much impressed with this poem, that it would
have encouraged me to publish the whole as it then stood; but the
Mariner's fate appeared to me so tragical, as to require a treatment
more subdued, and yet more strictly applicable in expression, than I had
at first given to it. This fault was corrected nearly fifty years
afterwards, when I determined to publish the whole. It may be worth
while to remark, that though the incidents of this attempt do only in a
small degree produce each other, and it deviates accordingly from the
general rule by which narrative pieces ought to be governed, it is not
therefore wanting in continuous hold upon the mind, or in unity, which
is effected by the identity of moral interest that places the two
personages upon the same footing in the reader's sympathies. My ramble
over many parts of Salisbury Plain put me, as mentioned in the preface,
upon writing this poem, and left upon my mind imaginative impressions
the force of which I have felt to this day. From that district I
proceeded to Bath, Bristol, and so on to the banks of the Wye; when I
took again to travelling on foot. In remembrance of that part of my
journey, which was in 1793, I began the verses,</p>

schoolfellow and friend, Charles Farish, long since deceased. The verses
were by a brother of his, a man of promising genius, who died young.

<br />
<h3><a name="poem23" id="poem23" ></a>23. *<i>The Forsaken. Poems founded on the Affections</i>. [XII.]</h3>

<p>This was an overflow from the affliction of Margaret, and excluded as
superfluous there; but preserved in the faint hope that it may turn to
account, by restoring a shy lover to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>{12}</span> forsaken damsel; my poetry
having been complained of as deficient in interests of this sort, a
charge which the next piece, beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Lyre! though such power do in thy magic live!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>will scarcely tend to obviate. The natural imagery of these verses was
supplied by frequent, I might say intense, observation of the Rydal
Torrent. What an animating contrast is the ever-changing aspect of that,
and indeed of every one of our mountain brooks, to the monotonous tone
and unmitigated fury of such streams among the Alps as are fed all the
summer long by glaciers and melting snows! A traveller, observing the
exquisite purity of the great rivers, such as the Rhone at Geneva, and
the Reuss at Lucerne, where they issue out of their respective lakes,
might fancy for a moment that some power in Nature produced this
beautiful change, with a view to make amends for those Alpine sullyings
which the waters exhibit near their fountain heads; but, alas! how soon
does that purity depart, before the influx of tributary waters that have
flowed through cultivated plains and the crowded abodes of men.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem24" id="poem24" ></a>24. *<i>The Borderers: a Tragedy</i>.</h3>

<p>Of this dramatic work I have little to say in addition to the short
printed note which will be found attached to it. It was composed at
Racedown in Dorset, during the latter part of the year 1795, and in the
course of the following year. Had it been the work of a later period of
life, it would have been different in some respects from what it is now.
The plot would have been something more complex, and a greater variety
of characters introduced, to relieve the mind from the pressure of
incidents so mournful; the manners also would have been more attended
to. My care was almost exclusively given to the passions and the
characters, and the position in which the persons in the drama stood
relatively to each other, that the reader (for I never thought of the
stage at the time it was written) might be moved, and to a degree
instructed, by lights penetrating somewhat into the depths of our
nature. In this endeavour, I cannot think, upon a very late review, that
I have failed. As to the scene and period of action, little more was
required for my purpose than the absence of established law and
government<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>{13}</span>, so that the agents might be at liberty to act on their own
impulses. Nevertheless, I do remember, that having a wish to colour the
manners in some degree from local history more than my knowledge enabled
me to do, I read Redpath's <i>History of the Borders</i>, but found there
nothing to my purpose. I once made an observation to Sir W. Scott, in
which he concurred, that it was difficult to conceive how so dull a book
could be written on such a subject. Much about the same time, but a
little after, Coleridge was employed in writing his tragedy of
<i>Remorse</i>; and it happened soon after that, through one of the Mr.
Pooles, Mr. Knight, the actor, heard that we had been engaged in writing
plays, and, upon his suggestion, mine was curtailed, and (I believe,
with Coleridge's) was offered to Mr. Harris, manager of Covent Garden.
For myself, I had no hope, nor even a wish (though a successful play
would in the then state of my finances have been a most welcome piece of
good fortune), that he should accept my performance; so that I incurred
no disappointment when the piece was <i>judiciously</i> returned as not
calculated for the stage. In this judgment I entirely concurred; and had
it been otherwise, it was so natural for me to shrink from public
notice, that any hope I might have had of success would not have
reconciled me altogether to such an exhibition. Mr. C.'s play was, as is
well known, brought forward several years after, through the kindness of
Mr. Sheridan. In conclusion, I may observe, that while I was composing
this play, I wrote a short essay, illustrative of that constitution and
those tendencies of human nature, which make the apparently <i>motiveless</i>
actions of bad men intelligible to careful observers. This was partly
done with reference to the character of Oswald, and his persevering
endeavour to lead the man he disliked into so heinous a crime; but still
more to preserve in my distinct remembrance what I had observed of
transitions in character, and the reflections I had been led to make,
during the time I was a witness of the changes through which the French
Revolution passed.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem25" id="poem25" ></a>25. The following is the 'short printed note' mentioned in above:</h3>

<p>This Dramatic Piece, as noticed in its title-page, was composed in
1795-6. It lay nearly from that time till within the<span class="pagenum">
<a name="page14" id="page14"></a>{14}</span> last two or three
months unregarded among my papers, without being mentioned even to my
most intimate friends. Having, however, impressions upon my mind which
made me unwilling to destroy the MS., I determined to undertake the
responsibility of publishing it during my own life, rather than impose
upon my successors the task of deciding its fate. Accordingly it has
been revised with some care; but, as it was at first written, and is now
published, without any view to its exhibition upon the stage, not the
slightest alteration has been made in the conduct of the story, or the
composition of the characters; above all, in respect to the two leading
Persons of the Drama, I felt no inducement to make any change. The study
of human nature suggests this awful truth, that, as in the trial to
which life subjects us, sin and crime are apt to start from their very
opposite qualities, so are there no limits to the hardening of the
heart, and the perversion of the understanding to which they may carry
their slaves. During my long residence in France, while the Revolution
was rapidly advancing to its extreme of wickedness, I had frequent
opportunities of being an eye-witness of this process, and it was while
that knowledge was fresh upon my memory that the Tragedy of the
<i>Borderers</i> was composed.</p>

<h3><a name="poem26" id="poem26" ></a>26.</h3>
<p>Later, this was prefixed: 'Readers already acquainted with my Poems
will recognise, in the following composition, some eight or ten lines
which I have not scrupled to retain in the places where they originally
stood. It is proper, however, to add, that they would not have been used
elsewhere, if I had foreseen the time when I might be induced to publish
this Tragedy. February 28. 1842.'</p>

me to put it into verse for humanity's sake. The humbleness, meanness if
you like, of the subject, together with the homely mode of treating it,
brought upon me a world of ridicule by the small critics, so that in

circumstance told me by my sister, of a little girl, who, not far from
Halifax, in Yorkshire, was bewildered in a snow-storm. Her footsteps
were tracked by her parents to the middle of the lock of a canal, and no
other vestige of her, backward or forward, could be traced. The body,
however, was found in the canal. The way in which the incident was
treated, and the spiritualising of the character, might furnish hints
for contrasting the imaginative influences, which I have endeavoured to
throw over common life, with Crabbe's matter-of-fact style of handling
subjects of the same kind. This is not spoken to his disparagement, far
from it; but to direct the attention of thoughtful readers into whose
hands these notes may fall, to a comparison that may enlarge the circle
of their sensibilities, and tend to produce in them a catholic judgment.</p>

<br />
<h3><a name="poem36" id="poem36" ></a>36. *<i>We are Seven</i>. [X.] <i>The Ancient Mariner and Coleridge, &amp;c. &amp;c.</i></h3>

<p>Written at Alfoxden in the spring of 1798, under circumstances somewhat
remarkable. The little girl who is the heroine, I met within the area of
Goderich Castle in the year 1793. Having left the Isle of Wight, and
crost Salisbury Plain, as mentioned in the preface to 'Guilt and
Sorrow,' I proceeded by Bristol up the Wye, and so on to N. Wales to the
Vale of Clwydd, where I spent my summer under the roof of the father of
my friend, Robert Jones.</p>

<p>In reference to this poem, I will here mention one of the most
remarkable facts in my own poetic history, and that of Mr. Coleridge. In
the spring of the year 1798, he, my sister, and myself, started from
Alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon, with a view to visit Linton, and
the Valley of Stones near to it; and as our united funds were very
small, we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a poem, to
be sent to the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, set up by Phillips, the
bookseller, and edited by Dr. Aikin. Accordingly we set off, and
proceeded, along the Quantock Hills, towards Watchet; and in the course
of this walk was planned the poem of the 'Ancient Mariner,' founded on a
dream, as Mr. Coleridge said, of his friend Mr. Cruikshank. Much the
greatest part of the story was Mr. Coleridge's invention; but certain
parts I myself suggested; for example, some crime was to be committed
which would bring upon the Old Navigator, as Coleridge afterwards
delighted to call him, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>{17}</span> spectral persecution, as a consequence of
that crime and his own wanderings. I had been reading in Shelvocke's
<i>Voyages</i>, a day or two before, that, while doubling Cape Horn, they
frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude, the largest sort of
sea-fowl, some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet. 'Suppose,'
said I, 'you represent him as having killed one of these birds on
entering the South Sea, and that the tutelary spirits of these regions
take upon them to avenge the crime.' The incident was thought fit for
the purpose, and adopted accordingly. I also suggested the navigation of
the ship by the dead men, but do not recollect that I had anything more
to do with the scheme of the poem. The gloss with which it was
subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of us at the time,
at least not a hint of it was given to me, and I have no doubt it was a
gratuitous after-thought. We began the composition together, on that to
me memorable evening: I furnished two or three lines at the beginning of
the poem, in particular&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'And listen'd like a three years' child;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Mariner had his will.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These trifling contributions, all but one, (which Mr. C. has with
unnecessary scrupulosity recorded,) slipt out of his mind, as they well
might. As we endeavoured to proceed conjointly (I speak of the same
evening), our respective manners proved so widely different, that it
would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but separate
from an undertaking upon which I could only have been a clog. We
returned after a few days from a delightful tour, of which I have many
pleasant, and some of them droll enough, recollections. We returned by
Dulverton to Alfoxden. The 'Ancient Mariner' grew and grew till it
became too important for our first object, which was limited to our
expectation of five pounds; and we began to talk of a volume which was
to consist, as Mr. Coleridge has told the world, of Poems chiefly on
natural subjects, taken from common life, but looked at, as much as
might be, through an imaginative medium. Accordingly I wrote 'The Idiot
Boy,' 'Her Eyes are wild,' &amp;c., and 'We are Seven,' 'The Thorn,' and
some others. To return to 'We are Seven,' the piece that called forth
this note:&mdash;I composed it while walking in the grove of Alfoxden. My
friends will not deem it too trifling to relate, that while walking to
and fro I composed the last stanza first, having begun with the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>{18}</span>line. When it was all but finished, I came in and recited it to Mr.
Coleridge and my sister, and said, 'A prefatory stanza must be added,
and I should sit down to our little tea-meal with greater pleasure if my
task was finished.' I mentioned in substance what I wished to be
expressed, and Coleridge immediately threw off the stanza, thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'A little child, dear brother Jem.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I objected to the rhyme, 'dear brother Jem,' as being ludicrous; but we
all enjoyed the joke of hitching in our friend James Tobin's name, who
was familiarly called Jem. He was the brother of the dramatist; and this
reminds me of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to notice.
The said Jem got a sight of the 'Lyrical Ballads' as it was going
through the press at Bristol, during which time I was residing in that
city. One evening he came to me with a grave face, and said,
'Wordsworth, I have seen the volume that Coleridge and you are about to
publish. There is one poem in it which I earnestly entreat you will
cancel, for, if published, it will make you everlastingly ridiculous.' I
answered, that I felt much obliged by the interest he took in my good
name as a writer, and begged to know what was the unfortunate piece he
alluded to. He said, 'It is called "We are Seven."' 'Nay,' said I, 'that
shall take its chance, however;' and he left me in despair. I have only
to add, that in the spring of 1841, I visited Goodrich Castle, not
having seen that part of the Wye since I met the little girl there in
1793. It would have given me greater pleasure to have found in the
neighbouring hamlet traces of one who had interested me so much, but
that was impossible, as, unfortunately, I did not even know her name.
The ruin, from its position and features, is a most impressive object. I
could not but deeply regret that its solemnity was impaired by a
fantastic new castle set up on a projection of the same ridge, as if to
show how far modern art can go in surpassing all that could be done by
antiquity and Nature with their united graces, remembrances, and
associations. I could have almost wished for power, so much the contrast
vexed me, to blow away Sir &mdash;&mdash; Meyrick's impertinent structure and all
the possessions it contains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>{19}</span></p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem37" id="poem37" ></a>37. <i>The Idle Shepherd Boys; or Dungeon-Ghyll Force: a Pastoral</i>. [XI.]</h3>

<p>Grasmere, Town-End, 1800. I will only add a little monitory anecdote
concerning this subject. When Coleridge and Southey were walking
together upon the Fells, Southey observed that, if I wished to be
considered a faithful painter of rural manners, I ought not to have said
that my shepherd boys trimmed their rustic hats as described in the
poem. Just as the words had past his lips, two boys appeared with the
very plant entwined round their hats. I have often wondered that
Southey, who rambled so much about the mountains, should have fallen
into this mistake; and I record it as a warning for others who, with far
less opportunity than my dear friend had of knowing what things are, and
with far less sagacity, give way to presumptuous criticism, from which
he was free, though in this matter mistaken. In describing a tarn under
Helvellyn, I say,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'There sometimes doth a leaping fish<br /></span>
<span>Send through the tarn a lonely cheer.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was branded by a critic of those days, in a review ascribed to Mrs.
Barbauld, as unnatural and absurd. I admire the genius of Mrs. Barbauld,
and am certain that, had her education been favourable to imaginative
influences, no female of her day would have been more likely to
sympathise with that image, and to acknowledge the truth of the
sentiment.</p>

<p>Heading: 'Dungeon-ghyll Force.' <i>Ghyll</i>, in the dialect of Cumberland
and Westmoreland, is a short and, for the most part, a steep narrow
valley, with a stream running through it. <i>Force</i> is the word
universally employed in these dialects for waterfall.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem39" id="poem39" ></a>39. <i>Anecdote for Fathers</i>. [XII.]</h3>

<p>This was suggested in front of Alfoxden. The boy was a son of my friend
Basil Montagu, who had been two or three years under our care. The name
of Kilve is from a village in the Bristol Channel, about a mile from
Alfoxden; and the name of Liswin Farm was taken from a beautiful spot on
the Wye. When Mr. Coleridge, my sister, and I had been visiting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>{20}</span>famous John Thelwall, who had taken refuge from politics, after a trial
for high treason, with a view to bring up his family by the profits of
agriculture; which proved as unfortunate a speculation as that he had
fled from. Coleridge and he had been public lecturers: Coleridge
mingling with his politics theology; from which the other abstained,
unless it were for the sake of a sneer. This quondam community of public
employment induced Thelwall to visit Coleridge at Nether Stowey, where
he fell in my way. He really was a man of extraordinary talent, an
affectionate husband, and a good father. Though brought up in the city
on a tailor's board, he was truly sensible of the beauty of natural
objects. I remember once when Coleridge, he and I were seated together
upon the turf, on the brink of a stream in the most beautiful part of
the most beautiful glen of Alfoxden, Coleridge exclaimed, 'This is a
place to reconcile one to all the jarrings and conflicts of the wide
world.' 'Nay,' said Thelwall, 'to make one forget them altogether.' The
visit of this man to Coleridge was, as I believe Coleridge has related,
the occasion of a spy being sent by Government to watch our proceedings;
which were, I can say with truth, such as the world at large would have
thought ludicrously harmless.</p>

though much changed as to beauty, was one of two most lovely sisters.
Almost the first words my poor brother John said, when he visited us for
the first time at Grasmere, were, 'Were those two angels that I have
just seen?' and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>{21}</span> his description I have no doubt they were those
two sisters. The mother died in childbed; and one of our neighbours, at
Grasmere, told me that the loveliest sight she had ever seen was that
mother as she lay in her coffin with her [dead] babe in her arm. I
mention this to notice what I cannot but think a salutary custom, once
universal in these vales: every attendant on a funeral made it a duty to
look at the corpse in the coffin before the lid was closed, which was
never done (nor I believe is now) till a minute or two before the corpse
was removed. Barbara Lewthwaite was not, in fact, the child whom I had
seen and overheard as engaged in the poem. I chose the name for reasons
implied in the above, and will here add a caution against the use of
names of living persons. Within a few months after the publication of
this poem, I was much surprised, and more hurt, to find it in a child's
school-book, which, having been compiled by Lindley Murray, had come
into use at Grasmere school, where Barbara was a pupil. And, alas, I had
the mortification of hearing that she was very vain of being thus
distinguished; and in after life she used to say that she remembered the
incident, and what I said to her upon the occasion.</p>

<br />
<h3><a name="poem44" id="poem44" ></a>44. <i>The Longest Day</i>. [XVII.]</h3>

<p>1817. Suggested by the sight of my daughter (Dora) playing in front of
Rydal Mount, and composed in a great measure the same afternoon. I have
often wished to pair this poem upon the 'longest' with one upon the
'shortest' day, and regret even now that it has not been done.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem45" id="poem45" ></a>45. <i>The Norman Boy</i>. [XVIII.]</h3>

<p>The subject of this poem was sent me by Mrs. Ogle, to whom I was
personally unknown, with a hope on her part that I might be induced to
relate the incident in verse. And I do not regret that I took the
trouble; for not improbably the fact is illustrative of the boy's early
piety, and may concur, with my other little pieces on children, to
produce profitable reflection among<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>{22}</span> my youthful readers. This is said,
however, with an absolute conviction that children will derive most
benefit from books which are not unworthy the perusal of persons of any
age. I protest with my whole heart against those productions, so
abundant in the present day, in which the doings of children are dwelt
upon as if they were incapable of being interested in anything else. On
this subject I have dwelt at length in the Poem on the growth of my own
mind. ['Prelude.']</p>

<h3><a name="poem46" id="poem46" ></a>46. <i>The Brothers</i>. [I.]</h3>

<p>1800. This poem was composed in a grove at the north-eastern end of
Grasmere Lake, which grove was in a great measure destroyed by turning
the high-road along the side of the water. The few trees that are left
were spared at my intercession. The poem arose out of the fact mentioned
to me, at Ennerdale, that a shepherd had fallen asleep upon the top of
the rock called the 'pillar,' and perished as here described, his staff
being left midway on the rock.</p>

<p>The Great Gavel, so called, I imagine, from its resemblance to the gable
end of a house, is one of the highest of the Cumberland mountains. The
Leeza is a river which flows into the Lake of Ennerdale.</p>

<h3><a name="poem48" id="poem48" ></a>48. <i>Artegal and Elidure</i>. [II.]</h3>

<p>Rydal Mount. This was written in the year 1815, as a token of
affectionate respect for the memory of Milton. 'I have determined,' says
he, in his preface to his History of England, 'to bestow the telling
over even of these reputed tales, be it for nothing else but in favour
of our English Poets and Rhetoricians, who by their wit well know how to
use them judiciously.' See the Chronicle of Geoffrey of Monmouth and
Milton's History of England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>{23}</span></p>

<p>This arose out of a flash of Moonlight that struck the ground when I was
approaching the steps that lead from the garden at Rydal Mount to the
front of the house. 'From her sunk eye a stagnant tear stole forth,' is
taken, with some loss, from a discarded poem, 'The Convict,' in which
occurred, when he was discovered lying in the cell, these lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'But now he upraises the deep-sunken eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The motion unsettles a tear;<br /></span>
<span>The silence of sorrow it seems to supply,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And asks of me, why I am here.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h3><a name="poem62" id="poem62" ></a>62. <i>The Complaint of a forsaken Indian Woman</i>. [XXI.]</h3>

<p>When a Northern Indian, from sickness, is unable to continue his journey
with his companions, he is left behind, covered over with deer-skins,
and is supplied with water, food, and fuel, if the situation of the
place will afford it. He is informed of the track which his companions
intend to pursue, and if he be unable to follow, or overtake them, he
perishes alone in the desert; unless he should have the good fortune to
fall in with some other tribes of Indians. The females are equally, or
still more, exposed to the same fate. See that very interesting work,
Hearne's <i>Journey from Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean</i>. In the high
northern latitudes, as the same writer informs us, when the northern
lights vary their position in the air, they make a rustling and a
crackling noise, as alluded to in the following poem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>{25}</span></p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem63" id="poem63" ></a>63. <i>Ibid.</i></h3>

<p>At Alfoxden, in 1798, where I read Hearne's <i>Journey</i> with great
interest. It was composed for the volume of 'Lyrical Ballads.'</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem64" id="poem64" ></a>64. <i>The Last of the Flock</i>. [XXII.]</h3>

<p>Produced at the same time [as 'The Complaint,' No. 62] and for the same
purpose. The incident occurred in the village of Holford, close by
Alfoxden.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem65" id="poem65" ></a>65. <i>Repentance</i> [XXIII.]</h3>

<p>Town-End, 1804. Suggested by the conversation of our next neighbour,
Margaret Ashburner.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem66" id="poem66" ></a>66. <i>The Affliction of Margaret</i> &mdash;&mdash;. [XXIV.]</h3>

<p>Town-End, 1804. This was taken from the case of a poor widow who lived
in the town of Penrith. Her sorrow was well known to Mary, to my sister,
and I believe to the whole town. She kept a shop, and when she saw a
stranger passing by, she was in the habit of going out into the street
to inquire of him after her son.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem67" id="poem67" ></a>67. <i>The Cottager to her Infant</i>. [XXV.]</h3>

<p>By my sister. Suggested to her while beside my sleeping children.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem68" id="poem68" ></a>68. <i>Maternal Grief</i>.</h3>

<p>This was in part an overflow from the Solitary's description of his own
and his wife's feelings upon the decease of their children; and I will
venture to add, for private notice solely, is faithfully set forth from
my wife's feelings and habits after the loss of our two children, within
half a year of each other.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem69" id="poem69" ></a>69. <i>The Sailor's Mother</i>. [XXVII.]</h3>

<p>Town-End, 1800. I met this woman near the Wishing-Gate, on the high-road
that then led from Grasmere to Ambleside. Her appearance was exactly as
here described, and such was her account, nearly to the letter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>{26}</span></p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem70" id="poem70" ></a>70. <i>The Childless Father</i>. [XXVIII.]</h3>

<p>Town-End, 1800. When I was a child at Cockermouth, no funeral took place
without a basin filled with sprigs of boxwood being placed upon a table
covered with a white cloth in front of the house. The huntings (on foot)
which the Old Man is suffered to join as here described were of common,
almost habitual, occurrence in our vales when I was a boy; and the
people took much delight in them. They are now less frequent.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem71" id="poem71" ></a>71. <i>Funeral Basin</i>.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Filled the funeral basin at Timothy's door.'</p></div>

<p>In several parts of the North of England, when a funeral takes place, a
basin full of sprigs of boxwood is placed at the door of the house from
which the coffin is taken up, and each person who attends the funeral
ordinarily takes a sprig of this boxwood, and throws it into the grave
of the deceased.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem72" id="poem72" ></a>72. <i>The Emigrant Mother</i>. [XXIX.]</h3>

<p>1802. Suggested by what I have noticed in more than one French fugitive
during the time of the French Revolution. If I am not mistaken, the
lines were composed at Sockburn when I was on a visit to Mary and her
brothers.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem73" id="poem73" ></a>73. <i>Vaudracour and Julia</i>. [XXX.]</h3>

<p>The following tale was written as an Episode, in a work from which its
length may perhaps exclude it. The facts are true; no invention as to
these has been exercised, as none was needed.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem74" id="poem74" ></a>74. <i>Ibid.</i></h3>

<p>Town-End, 1805. Faithfully narrated, though with the omission of many
pathetic circumstances, from the mouth of a French lady, who had been an
eye and ear-witness of all that was done and said. Many long years after
I was told that Dupligne was then a monk in the Convent of La Trappe.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem75" id="poem75" ></a>75. <i>The Idiot Boy</i>.</h3>

<p>Alfoxden, 1798. The last stanza, 'The cocks did crow, and the sun did
shine so cold,' was the foundation of the whole. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>{27}</span> words were
reported to me by my dear friend Thomas Poole; but I have since heard
the same reported of other idiots. Let me add, that this long poem was
composed in the groves of Alfoxden, almost extempore; not a word, I
believe, being corrected, though one stanza was omitted. I mention this
in gratitude to those happy moments, for, in truth, I never wrote
anything with so much glee.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem76" id="poem76" ></a>76. <i>Michael</i>. [XXXII.]</h3>

<p>Town-End, 1807. Written about the same time as 'The Brothers.' The
sheepfold on which so much of the poem turns, remains, or rather the
ruins of it. The character and circumstances of Luke were taken from a
family to whom had belonged, many years before, the house we lived in at
Town-End, along with some fields and woodlands on the eastern shore of
Grasmere. The name of the Evening Star was not in fact given to this
house, but to another on the same side of the valley more to the north.

     169).</p></div>

<p>Clipping is the word used in the North of England for shearing.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem78" id="poem78" ></a>78. <i>The Widow on Windermere Side</i>. [XXXIV.]</h3>

<p>The facts recorded in this Poem were given me and the character of the
person described by my highly esteemed friend the Rev. R. P. Graves, who
has long officiated as Curate at Bowness, to the great benefit of the
parish and neighbourhood. The individual was well known to him. She died
before these Verses were composed. It is scarcely worth while to notice
that the stanzas are written in the sonnet-form; which was adopted when
I thought the matter might be included in 28 lines.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem79" id="poem79" ></a>79. <i>The Armenian Lady's Love</i>. [XXXIV.]</h3>

<p>The subject of the following poem is from the 'Orlandus' of the author's
friend, Kenelm Henry Digby: and the liberty is taken of inscribing it to
him as an acknowledgment, however unworthy, of pleasure and instruction
derived from his numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>{28}</span> and valuable writings, illustrative of the
piety and chivalry of the olden time. *Rydal Mount, 1830.</p>

expression of one of Mr. Swinburne's children.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem82" id="poem82" ></a>82. *<i>Farewell Lines</i>. [XXXVI.]</h3>

<p>These Lines were designed as a farewell to Charles Lamb and his Sister,

<h3><a name="poem84" id="poem84" ></a>84. *(2)</h3>

<p>Rydal Mount, 1834. Our cats having been banished the house, it was soon
frequented by Red-breasts. Two or three of them, when the window was
open, would come in, particularly when Mary was breakfasting alone, and
hop about the table picking up the crumbs. My Sister being then confined
to her room by sickness, as, dear creature, she still is, had one that,
without being caged, took up its abode with her, and at night used to
perch upon a nail from which a picture had hung. It used to sing and fan
her face with its wings in a manner that was very touching. [In

<br />
<h3><a name="poem86" id="poem86" ></a>86. <i>Advertisement</i>.</h3>

<p>By persons resident in the country and attached to rural objects, many
places will be found unnamed or of unknown names, where little Incidents
must have occurred, or feelings been experienced, which will have given
to such places a private and peculiar interest. From a wish to give some
sort of record to such Incidents, and renew the gratification of such
feelings, Names have been given to Places by the Author and some of his
Friends, and the following Poems written in consequence.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem87" id="poem87" ></a>87. *<i>It was an April Morn, &amp;c.</i> [I.]</h3>

<p>Grasmere, 1800. This poem was suggested on the banks of the brook that
runs through Easedale, which is, in some parts of its course, as wild
and beautiful as brook can be. I have composed thousands of verses by
the side of it.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem88" id="poem88" ></a>88. *'<i>May call it Emmas Dell'</i> (I. 47).</h3>

was Emma?]</p>

<br />
<h3><a name="poem89" id="poem89" ></a>89. *<i>To Joanna Hutchinson</i>. [II.]</h3>

<p>Grasmere, 1800. The effect of her laugh is an extravagance; though the
effect of the reverberation of voices in some parts of these mountains
is very striking. There is, in 'The Excursion,' an allusion to the bleat
of a lamb thus re-echoed and described, without any exaggeration, as I
heard it on the side of Stickle Tarn, from the precipice that stretches
on to Langdale Pikes.</p>

<br />
<h3><a name="poem90" id="poem90" ></a>90. <i>Inscriptions</i>.</h3>

<p>In Cumberland and Westmoreland are several Inscriptions upon the native
rock, which, from the wasting of time, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>{30}</span> rudeness of the
workmanship, have been mistaken for Runic. They are without doubt Roman.
The Rotha mentioned in the poem is the River which, flowing through the
lakes of Grasmere and Ryedale, falls into Wynandermere. On Helmcrag,
that impressive single mountain at the head of the Vale of Grasmere, is
a rock which from most points of view bears a striking resemblance to an
old woman cowering. Close by this rock is one of those fissures or
caverns which in the language of the country are called dungeons. Most
of the mountains here mentioned immediately surround the Vale of
Grasmere; of the others, some are at a considerable distance, but they
belong to the same cluster.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem91" id="poem91" ></a>91. *<i>There is an Eminence, &amp;c.</i> [III.]</h3>

<p>1800. It is not accurate that the eminence here alluded to could be seen
from our orchard seat. It arises above the road by the side of Grasmere
Lake, towards Keswick, and its name is Stone Arthur.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem92" id="poem92" ></a>92. *'<i>A narrow Girdle of rough Stones and Crags'</i> [IV.]</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'&mdash;&mdash;Point Kash Judgment' (last line).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>1800. The character of the eastern shore of Grasmere Lake is quite
changed since these verses were written, by the public road being
carried along its side. The friends spoken of were Coleridge and my
sister, and the fact occurred strictly as recorded.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem93" id="poem93" ></a>93. *<i>To Mary Hutchinson</i>. [V.]</h3>

<p>Two years before our marriage. The pool alluded to is in Rydal Upper

<br />

<p>1805. The grove still exists; but the plantation has been walled in, and
is not so accessible as when my brother John wore the path in the manner
here described. The grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we

friends, this Grove in unimpaired beauty forty-one years after. [The

Grasmere. The ponderous block of stone, which is mentioned in the poem,
remains, I believe, to this day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>{32}</span> a good way up Nab-Scar. Broom grows

<p>This Poem, and two others to the same flower, were written in the year
1802; which is mentioned, because in some of the ideas, though not in
the manner in which those ideas are connected, and likewise even in some
of the expressions, there is a resemblance to passages in a Poem (lately
published) of Mr. [James] Montgomery's, entitled a 'Field Flower.' This
being said, Mr. Montgomery will not think any apology due to him; but I
cannot, however, help addressing him in the words of the Father of
English Poets:</p>

<p>Grasmere, Town-End. It is remarkable that this flower coming out so
early in the spring as it does, and so bright and beautiful, and in such
profusion, should not have been noticed earlier in English verse. What
adds much to the interest that attends it, is its habit of shutting
itself up and opening out according to the degree of light and
temperature of the air. [In pencil on opposite page&mdash;Has not Chaucer

Somerset House and Blackfriars Bridge. Charles Lamb was with me at the
time; and I thought it <span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>{34}</span>remarkable that I should have to point out to
<i>him</i>, an idolatrous Londoner, a sight so interesting as the happy group
dancing on the platform. Mills of this kind used to he, and perhaps
still are, not uncommon on the Continent. I noticed several upon the
river Saone in the year 1799; particularly near the town of Chalons,
where my friend Jones and I halted a day when we crossed France, so far
on foot. There we embarked and floated down to Lyons.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem115" id="poem115" ></a>115. *<i>The Pilgrim's Dream; or the Star and the Glowworm</i>. [XXV.]</h3>

<p>I distinctly recollect the evening when these verses were suggested in
1818. It was on the road between Rydal and Grasmere, where glow-worms
abound. A star was shining above the ridge of Loughrigg Fell just
opposite. I remember a blockhead of a critic in some Review or other
crying out against this piece. 'What so monstrous,' said he, 'as to make
a star talk to a glowworm!' Poor fellow, we know well from this sage
observation what the 'primrose on the river's brim was to him.'</p>

<p>Further&mdash;In writing to Coleridge he says: 'I parted from M&mdash;&mdash; on Monday
afternoon, about six o'clock, a little on this side Rushyford. Soon
after I missed my road in the midst of the storm.... Between the
beginning of Lord Darlington's park at Raby, and two or three miles
beyond Staindrop, I composed the poem on the opposite page ['The
Pilgrim's Dream,' &amp;c.]. I reached Barnard Castle about half-past ten.
Between eight and nine evening I reached Eusemere.' [<i>Memoirs</i>, i. pp.

daughter by our excellent friend Miss Jewsbury, who went to India with
her husband Mr. Fletcher, where she died of cholera. The dove survived
its mate many years, and was killed, to our great sorrow, by a
neighbour's cat that got in at the window and dragged it partly out of
the cage. These verses were composed extempore, to the letter, in the
Terrace Summer-house before spoken of. It was the habit of the bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>{35}</span> to
begin cooing and murmuring whenever it heard me making my verses. [In

<p>It has been said that the English, though their country has produced so
many great poets, is now the most unpoetical nation in Europe. It is
probably true; for they have more temptation to become so than any other
European people. Trade, commerce, and manufactures, physical science and
mechanic arts, out of which so much wealth has arisen, have made our
countrymen infinitely less sensible to movements of imagination and
fancy than were our forefathers in their simple state of society. How
touching and beautiful were in most instances the names they gave to our
indigenous flowers, or any other they were familiarly acquainted with!
Every month for many years have we been importing plants and flowers
from all quarters of the globe, many of which are spread through our
gardens, and some, perhaps, likely to be met with on the few commons
which we have left. Will their botanical names ever be displaced by
plain English appellations which will bring them home to our hearts by
connection with our joys and sorrows? It can never be, unless society
treads back her steps towards those simplicities which have been
banished by the undue influence of towns spreading and spreading in
every direction, so that city life with every generation takes more and
more the lead of rural. Among the ancients, villages were reckoned the
seats of barbarism. Refinement, for the most part false, increases the
desire to accumulate wealth; and, while theories of political economy
are boastfully pleading for the practice, inhumanity pervades all our
dealings in buying and selling. This selfishness wars against
disinterested imagination in all directions, and, evils coming round in
a circle, barbarism spreads in every quarter of our island. Oh, for the
reign of justice! and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>{36}</span> the humblest man among us would have more
peace and dignity in and about him than the highest have now.</p>

<p>MY DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p>When I sent you, a few weeks ago, 'The Tale of Peter Bell,' you asked
'why "The Waggoner" was not added?'&mdash;To say the truth,&mdash;from the higher
tone of imagination, and the deeper touches of passion aimed at in the
former, I apprehended, this little Piece could not accompany it without
disadvantage. In the year 1806, if I am not mistaken, 'The Waggoner' was
read to you in manuscript, and, as you have remembered it for so long a
time, I am the more encouraged to hope that, since the localities on
which the Poem partly depends did not prevent its being interesting to
you, it may prove acceptable to others. Being therefore in some measure
the cause of its present appearance, you must allow me the gratification
of inscribing it to you; in acknowledgment of the pleasure I have
derived from your Writings, and of the high esteem with which I am very truly yours, <br />WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.</p>

<p>Several years after the event that forms the subject of the Poem, in
company with my friend, the late Mr. Coleridge, I happened to fall in
with the person to whom the name of Benjamin is given. Upon our
expressing regret that we had not, for a long time, seen upon the road
either him or his waggon, he said:&mdash;'They could not do without me; and
as to the man who was put in my place, no good could come out of him; he
was a man of no <i>ideas</i>.'</p>

<p>The fact of my discarded hero's getting the horses out of a difficulty
with a word, as related in the poem, was told me by an eye-witness.</p>

<h3><a name="poem128" id="poem128" ></a>128. *<i>There was a Boy</i>. [I.]</h3>

<p>Written in Germany, 1799. This is an extract from the Poem on my own
poetical education. This practice of making an instrument of their own
fingers is known to most boys, though some are more skilful at it than
others. William Raincock of Rayrigg, a fine spirited lad, took the lead
of all my schoolfellows in this art.</p>

<h3><a name="poem131" id="poem131" ></a>131. *<i>Yew-trees</i>. [V.]</h3>

<p>Grasmere, 1803. These Yew-trees are still standing, but the spread of
that at Lorton is much diminished by mutilation. I will here mention
that a little way up the hill on the road leading from Rossthwaite to
Stonethwaite lay the trunk of a yew-tree which appeared as you
approached, so vast was its diameter, like the entrance of a cave, and
not a small one. Calculating upon what I have observed of the slow
growth of this tree in rocky situations, and of its durability, I have
often thought that the one I am describing must have been as old as the
Christian era. The tree lay in the line of a fence. Great masses of its
ruins were strewn about, and some had been rolled down the hill-side and
lay near the road at the bottom. As you approached the tree you were
struck with the number of shrubs and young plants, ashes, &amp;c. which had
found a bed upon the decayed trunk and grew to no inconsiderable height,
forming, as it were, a part of the hedgerow. In no part of England, or
of Europe, have I ever seen a yew-tree at all approaching this in
magnitude, as it must have stood. By the bye, Hutton, the Old Guide of
Keswick, had been so imprest with the remains of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>{39}</span> tree that he used
gravely to tell strangers that there could be no doubt of its having
been in existence before the Flood.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem132" id="poem132" ></a>132. *<i>Nutting</i>. [VI.]</h3>

<p>Written in Germany: intended as part of a poem on my own life, but
struck out as not being wanted there. Like most of my schoolfellows I
was an impassioned Nutter. For this pleasure the Vale of Esthwaite,
abounding in coppice wood, furnished a very wide range. These verses
arose out of the remembrance of feelings I had often had when a boy, and
particularly in the extensive woods that still stretch from the side of
Esthwaite Lake towards Graythwaite, the seat of the ancient family of
Sandys.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem133" id="poem133" ></a>133. *<i>She was a Phantom of Delight</i>. [VIII.]</h3>

of the verses on the Highland Girl. Though beginning in this way, it was
written from my heart, as is sufficiently obvious.</p>

The daffodils grew and still grow on the margin of Ulswater, and
probably may be seen to this day as beautiful in the month of March
nodding their golden heads beside the dancing and foaming waves. [In

</p>

<p>MT DEAR WRANGHAM,</p>

<p>I am indeed much pleased that Mrs. Wrangham and yourself have been
gratified by these breathings of simple nature; the more so, because I
conclude from the character of the Poems<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>{40}</span> which you have particularised
that the Volumes cannot but improve upon you. I see that you have
entered into the spirit of them. You mention 'The Daffodils.' You know
Butler, Montagu's friend: not Tom Butler, but the Conveyancer: when I
was in town in spring, he happened to see the Volumes lying on Montagu's
mantle-piece, and to glance his eye upon the very poem of 'The
Daffodils.' 'Aye,' says he, 'a fine morsel this for the Reviewers.' When
this was told me (for I was not present), I observed that there were
<i>two lines</i> in that little poem which, if thoroughly felt, would
annihilate nine-tenths of the reviews of the kingdom, as they would find
no readers; the lines I alluded to were these:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'They flash upon that inward eye<br /></span>
<span>Which is the bliss of solitude.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>[These two lines were composed by Mrs. Wordsworth: <i>Memoirs</i>, i. 183-4.]</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem138" id="poem138" ></a>138. *<i>The Reverie of poor Susan</i>. [XIII.]</h3>

<p>Written 1801 or 1802. This arose out of my observations of the affecting
music of these birds, hanging in this way in the London streets during
the freshness and stillness of the Spring morning.</p>


<br />

<br />
<h3><a name="poem142" id="poem142" ></a>142. *<i>Beggars</i>. [XVIII.]</h3>

<p>Town-End, 1802. Met and described by me to my sister near the Quarry at
the head of Rydal Lake&mdash;a place still a chosen resort of vagrants
travelling with their families.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem143" id="poem143" ></a>143. *<i>Gipsies</i>. [XX.]</h3>

<p>Composed at Coleorton, 1807. I had observed them, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>{41}</span> here described,
near Castle Donnington on my way to and from Derby.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem144" id="poem144" ></a>144. *<i>Ruth</i>.</h3>

Somersetshire.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem145" id="poem145" ></a>145. *<i>Resolution and Independence</i>. [XXII.]</h3>

<p>Town-End, 1807. This old man I met a few hundred yards from my cottage
at Town-End, Grasmere; and the account of him is taken from his own
mouth. I was in the state of feeling described in the beginning of the
poem, while crossing over Barton Fell from Mr. Clarkson's at the foot of
Ullswater, towards Askham. The image of the hare I then observed on the
ridge of the Fell.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem146" id="poem146" ></a>146. *<i>The Thorn</i>. [XXIII.]</h3>

<p>Alfoxden, 1798. Arose out of my observing on the ridge of Quantock Hill,
on a stormy day, a thorn, which I had often past in calm and bright
weather without noticing it. I said to myself, cannot I by some
invention do as much to make this Thorn permanently an impressive object
as the storm has made it to my eyes at this moment? I began the poem
accordingly, and composed it with great rapidity. Sir George Beaumont
painted a picture from it, which Wilkie thought his best. He gave it to
me; though, when he saw it several times at Rydal Mount afterwards, he
said, 'I could make a better, and would like to paint the same subject
over again.' The sky in this picture is nobly done, but it reminds one
too much of Wilson. The only fault however, of any consequence, is the
female figure, which is too old and decrepit for one likely to frequent

<p>Hart-Leap Well is a small spring of water, about five miles from
Richmond in Yorkshire, and near the side of the road that leads from
Richmond to Askrigg. Its name is derived from a remarkable Chase, the
memory of which is preserved by the monuments spoken of in the second
Part of the following Poem, which monuments do now exist as I have there

<p>Town-End, 1800. The first eight stanzas were composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>{42}</span> extempore one
winter evening in the cottage; when, after having tired and disgusted
myself with labouring at an awkward passage in 'The Brothers,' I started
with a sudden impulse to this, to get rid of the other, and finished it
in a day or two. My sister and I had past the place a few weeks before
in our wild winter journey from Sockburn on the banks of the Tees to
Grasmere. A peasant whom we met near the spot told us the story, so far
as concerned the name of the well, and the hart, and pointed out the
stones. Both the stones and the well are objects that may easily be
missed: the tradition by this time may be extinct in the neighbourhood:
the man who related it to us was very old.</p>

<h3><a name="poem149" id="poem149" ></a>149. <i>Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle</i>. [XXV.]</h3>

<p>Henry Lord Clifford, &amp;c. &amp;c., who is the subject of this Poem, was the
son of John Lord Clifford, who was slain at Towton Field, which John
Lord Clifford, as is known to the reader of English history, was the
person who after the battle of Wakefield slew, in the pursuit, the young
Earl of Rutland, son of the Duke of York, who had fallen in the battle,
'in part of revenge' (say the Authors of the <i>History of Cumberland and
Westmoreland</i>); 'for the Earl's father had slain his.' A deed which
worthily blemished the author (saith Speed); but who, as he adds, 'dare
promise anything temperate of himself in the heat of martial fury?
chiefly, when it was resolved not to leave any branch of the York line
standing; for so one maketh this Lord to speak.' This, no doubt, I would
observe by the bye, was an action sufficiently in the vindictive spirit
of the times, and yet not altogether so bad as represented; 'for the
Earl was no child, as some writers would have him, but able to bear
arms, being sixteen or seventeen years of age, as is evident from this,
(say the <i>Memoirs of the Countess of Pembroke</i>, who was laudably anxious
to wipe away, as far as could be, this stigma from the illustrious name
to which she was born,) that he was the next child to King Edward the
Fourth, which his mother had by Richard Duke of York, and that King was
then eighteen years of age: and for the small distance betwixt her
children, see Austin Vincent, in his <i>Book of Nobility</i>, p. 622,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>{43}</span> where
he writes of them all. It may further he observed, that Lord Clifford,
who was then himself only 25 years of age, had been a leading man and
commander, two or three years together in the army of Lancaster, before
this time; and, therefore, would be less likely to think that the Earl
of Rutland might be entitled to mercy from his youth.&mdash;But, independent
of this act, at best a cruel and savage one, the Family of Clifford had
done enough to draw upon them the vehement hatred of the House of York:
so that after the battle of Towton there was no hope for them but in
flight and concealment. Henry, the subject of the poem, was deprived of
his estate and honours during the space of twenty-four years; all which
time he lived as a shepherd in Yorkshire, or in Cumberland, where the
estate of his father-in-law (Sir Lancelot Threlkeld) lay. He was
restored to his estate and honours in the first year of Henry the
Seventh. It is recorded that, 'when called to Parliament, he behaved
nobly and wisely; but otherwise came seldom to London or the Court; and
rather delighted to live in the country, where he repaired several of
his castles, which had gone to decay during the late troubles.' Thus far
is chiefly collected from Nicholson and Burn; and I can add, from my own
knowledge, that there is a tradition current in the village of Threlkeld
and its neighbourhood, his principal retreat, that, in the course of his
shepherd-life, he had acquired great astronomical knowledge. I cannot
conclude this note without adding a word upon the subject of those
numerous and noble feudal Edifices, spoken of in the Poem, the ruins of
some of which are, at this day, so great an ornament to that interesting
country. The Cliffords had always been distinguished for an honourable
pride in these Castles; and we have seen that after the wars of York and
Lancaster they were rebuilt; in the civil wars of Charles the First they
were again laid waste, and again restored almost to their former
magnificence by the celebrated Mary Anne Clifford, Countess of Pembroke,
&amp;c. &amp;c. Not more than twenty-five years after this was done, when the
estates of Clifford had passed into the family of Tufton, three of these
castles, namely, Brough, Brougham, and Pendragon, were demolished, and
the timber and other materials sold by Thomas Earl of Thanet. We will
hope that, when this order was issued, the Earl had not consulted the
text of Isaiah, 58th chap. 12th verse, to which the inscription placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>{44}</span>over the gate of Pendragon Castle, by the Countess of Pembroke (I
believe his grandmother), at the time she repaired that structure,
refers the reader:&mdash;'<i>And they that shall be of thee shall build the old
waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations;
and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of
paths to dwell in</i>.' The Earl of Thanet, the present possessor of the
estates, with a due respect for the memory of his ancestors, and a
proper sense of the value and beauty of these remains of antiquity, has
(I am told) given orders that they shall be preserved from all
depredations.</p>

a line of it was altered, and not any part of it written down till I

opposite side of Rydal Mere. I will here mention, for my dear sister's
sake, that while she was sitting alone one day, high up on this part of
Loughrigg Fell, she was so affected by the voice of the cuckoo, heard
from the crags at some distance, that she could not suppress a wish to
have a stone inscribed with her name among the rocks from which the
sound proceeded. On my return from my walk I recited those verses to
Mary, who was then confined with her son Thomas, who died in his seventh
year, as recorded on his headstone in Grasmere Churchyard.</p>

<p>How strange that any one should be puzzled with the name 'Triad' <i>after</i>
reading the poem! I have turned to Dr. Johnson, and there find '<i>Triad,
three united</i>,' and not a word more, as nothing more was needed. I
should have been rather mortified if <i>you</i> had not liked the piece, as I
think it contains some of the happiest verses I ever wrote. It had been
promised several years to two of the party before a fancy fit for the
performance struck me; it was then thrown off rapidly, and afterwards
revised with care. During the last week I wrote some stanzas on the
<i>Power of Sound</i>, which ought to find a place in my larger work if aught
should ever come of that.</p>

<p>In the book on the Lakes, which I have not at hand, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>{48}</span> passage rather
too vaguely expressed, where I content myself with saying, that after a
certain point of elevation the effect of mountains depends much more
upon their form than upon their absolute height. This point, which ought
to have been defined, is the one to which fleecy clouds (not thin watery
vapours) are accustomed to descend. I am glad you are so much interested
with this little tract; it could not have been written without long
experience.</p>

only, by way of comment, direct attention to the fact, that pictures of
animals and other productions of Nature, as seen in conservatories,
menageries and museums, &amp;c., would do little for the national mind, nay,
they would be rather injurious to it, if the imagination were excluded
by the presence of the object, more or less out of the state of Nature.
If it were not that we learn to talk and think of the lion and the
eagle, the palm-tree, and even the cedar, from the impassioned
introduction of them so frequently in Holy Scripture, and by great
poets, and divines who write as poets, the spiritual part of our nature,
and therefore the higher part of it, would derive no benefit from such
intercourse with such subjects.</p>

<h3><a name="poem179" id="poem179" ></a>179. *<i>A Jewish Family</i>. [L.]</h3>

<p>Coleridge and my daughter and I in 1828 passed a fortnight upon the
banks of the Rhine, principally under the hospitable roof of Mr. Aders
at Gotesburg, but two days of the time were spent at St. Goa or in
rambles among the neighbouring vallies. It was at St. Goa that I saw the
Jewish family here described. Though exceedingly poor, and in rags, they
were not less beautiful than I have endeavoured to make them appear. We
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>{50}</span> taken a little dinner with us in a basket, and invited them to
partake of it, which the mother refused to do both for herself and her
children, saying it was with them a fast-day; adding diffidently, that
whether such observances were right or wrong, <i>she</i> felt it her duty to
keep them strictly. The Jews, who are numerous in this part of the
Rhine, greatly surpass the German peasantry in the beauty of their
features and in the intelligence of their countenances. But the lower
classes of the German peasantry have, here at least, the air of people
grievously opprest. Nursing mothers at the age of seven or eight and
twenty often look haggard and far more decayed and withered than women
of Cumberland and Westmoreland twice their age. This comes from being
under-fed and over-worked in their vineyards in a hot and glaring sun.

chiefly performed in the short days of October in a carriage and four (I

<p>MY DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p>The Tale of 'Peter Bell,' which I now introduce to your notice, and to
that of the Public, has, in its Manuscript state, nearly survived its
<i>minority</i>:&mdash;for it first saw the light in the summer of 1798. During
this long interval, pains have been taken at different times to make the
production less unworthy of a favourable reception; or, rather, to fit
it for filling<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>{51}</span> <i>permanently</i> a station, however humble, in the
Literature of our Country. This has, indeed, been the aim of all my
endeavours in Poetry, which, you know, have been sufficiently laborious
to prove that I deem the Art not lightly to be approached; and that the
attainment of excellence in it may laudably be made the principal object
of intellectual pursuit by any man who, with reasonable consideration of
circumstances, has faith in his own impulses.</p>

<p>The Poem of 'Peter Bell,' as the Prologue will show, was composed under
a belief that the Imagination not only does not require for its exercise
the intervention of supernatural agency, but that, though such agency be
excluded, the faculty may be called forth as imperiously and for kindred
results of pleasure, by incidents, within the compass of poetic
probability, in the humblest departments of daily life. Since that
Prologue was written, <i>you</i> have exhibited most splendid effects of
judicious daring, in the opposite and usual course. Let this
acknowledgment make my peace with the lovers of the supernatural; and I
am persuaded it will be admitted that to you, as a Master in that
province of the art, the following Tale, whether from contrast or
congruity, is not an inappropriate offering. Accept it, then, as a
public testimony of affectionate admiration from one with whose name
yours has been often coupled (to use your own words) for evil and for
good; and believe me to be, with earnest wishes that life and health may
be granted you to complete the many important works in which you are
engaged, and with high respect,</p>

<h3><a name="poem182" id="poem182" ></a>182. <i>Peter Bell: the Poem</i>.</h3>

<p>Alfoxden, 1798. Founded upon an anecdote which I read in a newspaper, of
an ass being found hanging his head over a canal in a wretched posture.
Upon examination a dead body was found in the water, and proved to be
the body of its master. The countenance, gait, and figure of Peter were
taken from a wild rover with whom I walked from Builth, on the river
Wye, downwards, nearly as far as the town of Hay. He told me strange
stories. It has always been a pleasure to me, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>{52}</span> life, to catch at
every opportunity that has occurred in my rambles of becoming acquainted
with this class of people. The number of Peter's wives was taken from
the trespasses, in this way, of a lawless creature who lived in the
county of Durham, and used to be attended by many women, sometimes not
less than half a dozen, as disorderly as himself; and a story went in
the country, that he had been heard to say while they were quarrelling,
'Why can't you be quiet, there's none so many of you.' Benoni, or the
child of sorrow, I knew when I was a school-boy. His mother had been
deserted by a gentleman in the neighbourhood, she herself being a
gentlewoman by birth. The circumstances of her story were told me by my
dear old dame, Ann Tyson, who was her confidante. The lady died
broken-hearted. In the woods of Alfoxden I used to take great delight in
noticing the habits, tricks, and physiognomy of asses; and I have no
doubt that I was thus put upon writing the poem out of liking for the
creature that is so often dreadfully abused. The crescent moon, which
makes such a figure in the prologue, assumed this character one evening
while I was watching its beauty in front of Alfoxden House. I intended
this poem for the volume before spoken of, but it was not published for
more than twenty years afterwards. The worship of the Methodists, or
Ranters, is often heard during the stillness of the summer evening, in
the country, with affecting accompaniments of rural beauty. In both the
psalmody and voice of the preacher there is, not unfrequently, much
solemnity likely to impress the feelings of the rudest characters under
favourable circumstances.</p>

<h3><a name="poem183" id="poem183" ></a>183. *<i>Commencement of writing of Sonnets</i>.</h3>

<p>In the cottage of Town-End, one afternoon in 1801, my sister read to me
the sonnets of Milton. I had long been well acquainted with them, but I
was particularly struck on that occasion with the dignified simplicity
and majestic harmony that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>{53}</span> runs through most of them&mdash;in character so
totally different from the Italian, and still more so from Shakespeare's
fine sonnets. I took fire, if I may be allowed to say so, and produced
three sonnets the same afternoon&mdash;the first I ever wrote, except an
irregular one at school. Of these three, the only one I distinctly
remember is 'I grieved for Buonaparte,' &amp;c. One was never written down;
the third, which was I believe preserved, I cannot particularise.</p>

</div></div>

<p>This was presented to me by Sir George Beaumont, with a view to the
erection of a house upon it, for the sake of being near to Coleridge,
then living, and likely to remain, at Greta Hall, near Keswick. The
severe necessities that prevented this arose from his domestic
situation. This little property, with a considerable addition that still
leaves it very small, lies beautifully upon the banks of a rill that
gurgles down the side of Skiddaw; and the orchard and other parts of the
grounds command a magnificent prospect of Derwent Water, the Mountains
of Borrowdale and Newlands. Not many years ago I gave the place to my
daughter. [In pencil on opposite page in Mrs. Quillinan's
handwriting&mdash;Many years ago, sir, for it was given when she was a frail
feeble monthling.]</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'There is a little unpretending rill.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This rill trickles down the hill-side into Windermere near Lowood. My
sister and I, on our first visit together to this part of the country,
walked from Kendal, and we rested to refresh ourselves by the side of
the Lake where the streamlet falls into it. This sonnet was written some
years after in recollection of that happy ramble, that most happy day
and hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>{54}</span></p>

</div></div>

<p>Suggested at Hackett, which is the craggy ridge that rises between the
two Langdales, and looks towards Windermere. The cottage of Hackett was
often visited by us; and at the time when this sonnet was written, and
long after, was occupied by the husband and wife described in 'The
Excursion,' where it is mentioned that she was in the habit of walking
in the front of the dwelling with a light to guide her husband home at
night. The same cottage is alluded to in the Epistle to Sir G. Beaumont
as that from which the female peasant hailed us on our morning journey.
The musician mentioned in the sonnet was the Rev. P. Tilbrook of
Peterhouse, who remodelled the Ivy Cottage at Rydal after he had
purchased it.</p>

<p>Upon the sight of a beautiful picture.</p>

<p>This was written when we dwelt in the Parsonage at Grasmere. The
principal features of the picture are Bredon Hill and Cloud Hill, near
Coleorton. I shall never forget the happy feeling with which my heart
was filled when I was impelled to compose this sonnet. We resided only
two years in this house; and during the last half of this time, which
was after this poem had been written, we lost our two children, Thomas
and Catherine. Our sorrow upon these events often brought it to my mind,
and cast me upon the support to which the last line of it gives
expression:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'The appropriate calm of blest eternity.'<br /></span>

<p>I could write a treatise of lamentation upon the changes brought about
among the cottages of Westmoreland by the silence of the spinning-wheel.
During long winter's nights and wet days, the wheel upon which wool was
spun gave employment to a great part of a family. The old man, however
infirm, was able to card the wool, as he sate in the corner by the
fireside; and often, when a boy, have I admired the cylinders of carded
wool which were softly laid upon each other by his side. Two wheels were
often at work on the same floor, and others of the family, chiefly the
little children, were occupied in teazing and clearing the wool to fit
it for the hand of the carder. So that all, except the infants, were
contributing to mutual support: Such was the employment that prevailed
in the pastoral vales. Where wool was not at hand, in the small rural
towns, the wheel for spinning flax was almost in as constant use, if
knitting was not preferred; which latter occupation had the advantage
(in some cases disadvantage) that not being of necessity stationary, it
allowed of gossiping about from house to house, which good housewives
reckoned an idle thing.</p>

<p>Decay of Piety.</p>

<p>Attendance at church on prayer-days, Wednesdays and Fridays and
holidays, received a shock at the Revolution. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>{56}</span> now, however,
happily reviving. The ancient people described in this sonnet were among
the last of that pious class. May we hope that the practice now in some

<span>'From the dark chambers,' &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Composed in Edinburgh, during my Scotch tour with Mary and Sara, in the
year 1814. Poor Gillies never rose above the course of extravagance in
which he was at that time living, and which soon reduced him to poverty
and all its degrading shifts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>{57}</span> mendicity being far from the worst. I
grieve whenever I think of him; for he was far from being without
genius, and had a generous heart&mdash;which is not always to be found in men
given up to profusion. He was nephew of Lord Gillies, the Scotch judge,
and also of the historian of Greece. He was cousin of Miss Margaret
Gillies, who painted so many portraits with success in our house.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem200" id="poem200" ></a>200. *<i>Sonnet</i> V.</h3>

<p>'Fool, prime of life,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>Suggested by observation of the way in which a young friend, whom I do
not choose to name, misspent his time and misapplied his talents. He
took afterwards a better course, and became an useful member of society,
respected, I believe, wherever he has been known.</p>

<h3><a name="poem201" id="poem201" ></a>201. *<i>Sonnet</i> VI.</h3>

<p>Suggested in front of Rydal Mount, the rocky parapet being the summit of
Loughrigg Fell opposite. Not once only but a hundred times have the
feelings of this sonnet been awakened by the same objects from the same
place.</p>

<p>'For the whole weight,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>Composed, almost extempore, in a short walk on the western side of Rydal
Lake.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem204" id="poem204" ></a>204. *<i>Sonnet</i> X.</h3>

<p>'Mark the concentred hazels,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>Suggested in the wild hazel-wood at foot of Helm-Crag, where the stone
still lies, with others of like form and character, though much of the
wood that veiled it from the glare of day has been felled. This
beautiful ground was lately purchased by our friend, Mrs. Fletcher, the
ancient owners, most respected persons, being obliged to part with it in
consequence of the imprudence, if not misconduct, of a son. It is
gratifying to mention that instead of murmuring and repining at this
change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>{58}</span> fortune they offered their services to Mrs. Fletcher, the
husband as an out-door labourer and the wife as a domestic servant. I
have witnessed the pride and pleasure with which the man worked at
improvements of the ground round the house. Indeed he expressed them to
me himself, and the countenance and manner of his wife always denoted
feelings of the same character. I believe a similar disposition to
contentment under change of fortune is common among the class to which
these good people belong. Yet, in proof that to part with their
patrimony is most painful to them, I may refer to those stanzas entitled
'Repentance,' no inconsiderable part of which was taken <i>verbatim</i> from
the language of the speaker himself. [In pencil&mdash;Herself, M.N.]</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem205" id="poem205" ></a>205. *<i>Sonnet</i> XI.</h3>

<p>'Dark and more dark,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>October 3d or 4th, 1802. Composed after a journey over the Hambleton
Hills, on a day memorable to me&mdash;the day of my marriage. The horizon
commanded by those hills is most magnificent.</p>

<p>The next day, while we were travelling in a post-chaise up Wensley Dale,
we were stopt by one of the horses proving restiff, and were obliged to
wait two hours in a severe storm before the post-boy could fetch from
the Inn another to supply its place. The spot was in front of Bolton
Hall, where Mary Queen of Scots was kept prisoner soon after her
unfortunate landing at Workington. The place then belonged to the
Scroopes, and memorials of her are yet preserved there. To beguile the
time I composed a sonnet. The subject was our own confinement contrasted
with hers; but it was not thought worthy of being preserved.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem206" id="poem206" ></a>206. *<i>Sonnet</i> XIII.</h3>

<p>'While not a leaf,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>September 1815. 'For me, who under kindlier laws,' &amp;c. (l. 9). This
conclusion has more than once, to my great regret, excited painfully sad
feelings in the hearts of young persons fond of poetry and poetic
composition by contrast of their feeble and declining health with that
state of robust constitution which prompted me to rejoice in a season of
frost and snow as more favourable to the Muses than summer itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>{59}</span></p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem207" id="poem207" ></a>207. *<i>Sonnet</i> XIV.</h3>

<p>'How clear, how keen,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>November 1st. Suggested on the banks of the Brathay by the sight of
Langdale Pikes. It is delightful to remember those moments of
far-distant days, which probably would have been forgotten if the
impression had not been transferred to verse. The same observation
applies to the rest.</p>

<p>'Though narrow,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>1807. Coleorton. This old man's name was Mitchell. He was, in all his
ways and conversation, a great curiosity, both individually and as a
representative of past times. His chief employment was keeping watch at
night by pacing round the house at that time building, to keep off
depredators. He has often told me gravely of having seen the 'Seven
Whistlers and the Hounds' as here described. Among the groves of
Coleorton, where I became familiar with the habits and notions of old
Mitchell, there was also a labourer of whom I regret I had no personal
knowledge; for, more than forty years after, when he was become an old
man, I learnt that while I was composing verses, which I usually did
aloud, he took much pleasure, unknown to me, in following my steps, that
he might catch the words I uttered, and, what is not a little
remarkable, several<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>{60}</span> lines caught in this way kept their place in his
memory. My volumes have lately been given to him, by my informant, and
surely he must have been gratified to meet in print his old
acquaintance.</p>

<p>In this Vale of Meditation ['Glen Mywr'] my friend Jones resided, having
been allowed by his Diocesan to fix himself there without resigning his
living in Oxfordshire. He was with my wife and daughter and me when we
visited these celebrated ladies, who had retired, as one may say, into
notice in this vale. Their cottage lay directly in the road between
London and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>{61}</span> Dublin, and they were, of course, visited by their Irish
friends as well as innumerable strangers. They took much delight in
passing jokes on our friend Jones's plumpness, ruddy cheeks, and smiling
countenance, as little suited to a hermit living in the Vale of
Meditation. We all thought there was ample room for retort on his part,
so curious was the appearance of these ladies, so elaborately
sentimental about themselves and their <i>caro Albergo</i>, as they named it
in an inscription on a tree that stood opposite, the endearing epithet
being preceded by the word <i>Ecco</i>! calling upon the saunterer to look
about him. So oddly was one of these ladies attired that we took her, at
a little distance, for a Roman Catholic priest, with a crucifix and
relics hung at his neck. They were without caps; their hair bushy and
white as snow, which contributed to the mistake.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem218" id="poem218" ></a>218. <i>Sonnet</i> XI. In the Woods of Rydal.</h3>

<p>This Sonnet, as Poetry, explains itself, yet the scene of the incident
having been a wild wood, it may be doubted, as a point of natural
history, whether the bird was aware that his attentions were bestowed
upon a human, or even a living creature. But a Redbreast will perch upon
the foot of a gardener at work, and alight on the handle of the spade
when his hand is half upon it. This I have seen. And under my own roof I
have witnessed affecting instances of the creature's friendly visits to
the chambers of sick persons, as described in the verses to the
Redbreast [No. 83]. One of these welcome intruders used frequently to
roost upon a nail in the wall, from which a picture had hung, and was
ready, as morning came, to pipe his song in the hearing of the invalid,
who had been long confined to her room. These attachments to a
particular person, when marked and continued, used to be reckoned
ominous; but the superstition is passing away.</p>

itinerant Eidouranian philosopher. The beautiful pavement was discovered
within a few yards of the front door of his parsonage, and appeared
(from the site in full view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>{63}</span> several hills upon which there had

<p>I have reason to remember the day that gave rise to this Sonnet, the 6th
of November 1830. Having undertaken&mdash;a great feat for me&mdash;to ride my
daughter's pony from Westmoreland to Cambridge, that she might have the
use of it while on a visit to her uncle at Trinity Lodge, on my way from
Bakewell to Matlock I turned aside to Chatsworth, and had scarcely
gratified my curiosity by the sight of that celebrated place before
there came on a severe storm of wind and rain, which continued till I
reached Derby, both man and pony in a pitiable plight. For myself I went
to bed at noon-day. In the course of that journey I had to encounter a
storm worse if possible, in which the pony could (or would) only make
his way slantwise. I mention this merely to add, that notwithstanding
this battering, I composed on pony-back the lines to the memory of Sir
George Beaumont, suggested during my recent visit to Coleorton.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Tis said that to the brow,' &amp;c.<br /></span>

<p>This pleasing tradition was told me by the coachman at whose side I sate

related the story.</p>

<p>This was also communicated to me by a coachman in the same way. In the
course of my many coach rambles and journeys, which, during the daytime
always, and often in the night, were taken on the outside of the coach,
I had good and frequent opportunities of learning the character of this
class of men. One remark I made, that is worth recording, that whenever
I had occasion especially to notice their well-ordered, respectful, and
kind behaviour to women, of whatever age, I found them, I may say almost
always, to be married men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>{64}</span></p>

<p>'Go, faithful Tishart,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>The six last lines of this sonnet are not written for poetical effect,
but as a matter of fact, which in more than one instance could not
escape my notice in the servants of the house.</p>

<h3><a name="poem231" id="poem231" ></a>231. <i>Sonnet</i> XXV.</h3>

<p>'Why art thou silent?'</p>

<p>In the month of January [blank], when Dora and I were walking from
Town-End, Grasmere, across the vale, snow being on the ground, she
espied in the thick though leafless hedge a bird's-nest half filled with
snow. Out of this comfortless appearance arose this Sonnet, which was,
in fact, written without the least reference to any individual object,
but merely to prove to myself that I could, if I thought fit, write in a
strain that poets have been fond of. On the 14th of February in the same
year, my daughter, in a sportive mood, sent it as a Valentine under a
fictitious name to her cousin C. W.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem232" id="poem232" ></a>232. *<i>Sonnet</i> XXVI.</h3>

<p>'Haydon! let worthier judges,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>This Sonnet, though said to be written on seeing the portrait of
Napoleon, was in fact composed some time after, extempore, in Rydal
Mount. [In pencil&mdash;But it was said in prose in Haydon's studio, for I
was present: relate the facts and why it was versified.]</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem233" id="poem233" ></a>233. *<i>Sonnet</i> XXVII.</h3>

<p>'A poet!&mdash;He hath put,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>I was impelled to write this Sonnet by the disgusting frequency with
which the word <i>artistical</i>, imported with other impertinencies from the
Germans, is employed by writers of the present day. For 'artistical' let
them substitute 'artificial,' and the poetry written on this system,
both at home and abroad, will be, for the most part, much better
characterised.</p>

<h3><a name="poem234" id="poem234" ></a>234. *<i>Sonnet</i> XXVIII.</h3>

<p>'The most alluring clouds,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>Hundreds of times have I seen hanging about and above the Vale of Rydal,
clouds that might have given birth to this Sonnet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>{65}</span> which was thrown
off, on the impulse of the moment, one evening when I was returning home
from the favourite walk of ours along the Rotha, under Loughrigg.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem235" id="poem235" ></a>235. *<i>Sonnet</i> XXIX.</h3>

<p>'By Art's bold privilege,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>This was composed while I was ascending Helvelyn in company with my
daughter and her husband. She was on horseback, and rode to the very top
of the hill without once dismounting: a feat which it was scarcely
possible to perform except during a season of dry weather, and a guide
with whom we fell in on the mountain told us he believed it had never
been accomplished before by any one.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem236" id="poem236" ></a>236. *<i>Sonnet</i> XXXII.</h3>

<p>'All praise the likeness,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>The picture which gave occasion to this and the following Sonnet was
from the pencil of Miss M. Gillies, who resided for several weeks under
our roof at Rydal Mount.</p>

affected.</p>

<h3><a name="poem241" id="poem241" ></a>241. *<i>Setting out</i>.</h3>

<p>Mr. Coleridge, my sister, and myself started together from Town-End, to
make a tour in Scotland, August [14th]. Poor Coleridge was at that time
in bad spirits, and somewhat too much in love with his own dejection,
and he departed from us, as is recorded in my sister's Journal, soon
after we left Loch Lomond. The verses that stand foremost among these
memorials were not actually written for the occasion, but transplanted
from my Epistle to Sir G. Beaumont.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem242" id="poem242" ></a>242. *<i>To the Sons of Burns after visiting the Grave of their Father</i>.</h3>

<p>See, in connection with these verses, two other poems upon Burns, one
composed actually at the time, and the other, though then felt, not put
into words till several years afterwards [viz. 'At the Grave of Burns,
1803, Seven Years after his Death (II.);' and 'Thoughts suggested the
Day following, on the Banks of Nith, near the Poet's Residence.' (III.)
Another Note in I.F. MSS. is nearly the same as this: viz. To be printed
among the Poems relating to my first Tour in Scotland: for illustrations
see my Sister's Journal. It may be proper to add that the second of
these pieces, though <i>felt</i> at the time, was not composed till many
years after].</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem243" id="poem243" ></a>243. *<i>Ellen Irwin, or the Braes of Kirtle</i>. [v.]</h3>

<p>It may be worth while to observe, that as there are Scotch poems on this
subject, in the simple ballad strain, I thought it would be both
presumptuous and superfluous to attempt treating it in the same way; and
accordingly, I chose a construction of stanza quite new in our language;
in fact, the same as that of B&uuml;rgher's 'Leonora,' except that the first
and third lines do not in my stanzas rhyme. At the outset, I threw out a
classical image, to prepare the reader for the style in which I meant to
treat the story, and so to preclude all comparison. [Note.&mdash;The Kirtle
is a river in the southern part of Scotland, on the banks of which the
events here related took place.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>{67}</span></p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem244" id="poem244" ></a>244. *<i>To a Highland Girl</i>. [VI.]</h3>

<p>This delightful creature, and her demeanour, are particularly described
in my sister's Journal. The sort of prophecy with which the verses
conclude has, through God's goodness, been realised; and now,
approaching the close of my seventy-third year, I have a most vivid
remembrance of her, and the beautiful objects with which she was
surrounded. She is alluded to in the poem of 'The Three Cottage Girls,'
among my continental memorials. In illustration of this class of poems,
I have scarcely anything to say beyond what is anticipated in my
sister's faithful and admirable Journal.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem245" id="poem245" ></a>245. <i>Stepping Westward</i>. [VII.]</h3>

<p>While my fellow-traveller and I were walking by the side of Loch
Ketterine [Katrine] one fine evening after sunset, in our road to a Hut
where, in the course of our Tour, we had been hospitably entertained
some weeks before, we met, in one of the loneliest parts of that
solitary region, two well-dressed women, one of whom said to us, by way
of greeting, 'What, you are stepping westward?'</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem246" id="poem246" ></a>246. *<i>Address to Kilchurn Castle</i>. [X.]</h3>

<p>The first three lines were thrown off at the moment I first caught sight
of the ruin from a small eminence by the wayside; the rest was added
many years after. [Note.&mdash;The tradition is that the Castle was built by
a Lady during the absence of her Lord in Palestine.]</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem247" id="poem247" ></a>247. *<i>Rob Roys Grave</i>. [XI.]</h3>

<p>I have since been told that I was misinformed as to the burial-place of
Bob Roy; if so, I may plead in excuse that I wrote on apparently good
authority, namely, that of a well-educated lady, who lived at the head
of the Lake, within a mile, or less, of the point indicated as
containing the remains of one so famous in that neighbourhood. [Note
prefixed.&mdash;The history of Rob Roy is sufficiently known; his grave is
near the head of Loch Ketterine, in one of those small pinfold-like
burial-grounds, of neglected and desolate appearance, which the
traveller meets with in the Highlands of Scotland.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>{68}</span></p>

to was the then Duke of Queensberry. The fact was told me by Walter

<h3><a name="poem252" id="poem252" ></a>252. *<i>The Blind Highland Boy</i>. [XVII.]</h3>

<p>The story was told me by George Mackreth, for many years parish-clerk of
Grasmere. He had been an eye-witness of the occurrence. The vessel in
reality was a washing-tub, which the little fellow had met with on the
shore of the loch. [Appended Note.&mdash;It is recorded in Dampier's
<i>Voyages</i> that a boy, son of the captain of a man-of-war, seated himself
in a turtle-shell and floated in it from the shore to his father's ship,
which lay at anchor at the distance of half a mile. In deference to the
opinion of a friend, I have substituted such a shell for the less
elegant vessel in which my blind Voyager did actually intrust himself to
the dangerous current of Loch Leven, as was related to me by an
eye-witness.]</p>

Lomond: a place chosen for the retreat of a solitary individual, from
whom this Habitation acquired the name of the Brownie's Cell</i>. [I.]</h3>

<p>In this tour my wife and her sister Sara were my companions. The account
of the Brownie's Cell, and the Brownies, was given me by a man we met
with on the banks of Loch Lomond, a little above Tarbert, and in front
of a huge mass of rock by the side of which, we were told, preachings
were often held in the open air. The place is quite a solitude, and the
surrounding scenery very striking. How much is it to be regretted that,
instead of writing such poems as the 'Holy Fair,' and others in which
the religious observances of his country are treated with so much
levity, and too often with indecency, Burns had not employed his genius
in describing religion under the serious and affecting aspects it must
so frequently take.</p>

<h3><a name="poem254" id="poem254" ></a>254. *<i>Composed at Corra Linn, in sight of Wallace Tower</i>.[II.]</h3>

<p>I had seen this celebrated waterfall twice before. But the feelings to
which it had given birth were not expressed till they recurred in
presence of the object on this occasion.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem255" id="poem255" ></a>255. *<i>Effusion in the Pleasure-ground on the Banks of the Braw, near
Dunkeld. [III.]</i></h3>

<p>I am not aware that this condemnatory effusion was ever seen by the
owner of the place. He might be disposed to pay little attention to it;
but, were it to prove otherwise, I should be glad, for the whole
exhibition is distressingly puerile.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem256" id="poem256" ></a>256. *<i>Yarrow Visited</i>.[IV.]</h3>

<p>As mentioned in my verses on the death of the Ettrick Shepherd, my first
visit to Yarrow was in his company. We had lodged the night before at
Traquhair, where Hogg had joined us, and also Dr. Anderson, the editor
of the British Poets, who was on a visit at the Manse. Dr. A. walked
with us till we came<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>{70}</span> in view of the vale of Yarrow, and being advanced
in life he then turned back. The old man was passionately fond of
poetry, though with not much of a discriminating judgment, as the
volumes he edited sufficiently shew. But I was much pleased to meet with
him and to acknowledge my obligation to his Collection, which had been
my brother John's companion in more than one voyage to India, and which
he gave me before his departure from Grasmere never to return. Through
these volumes I became first familiar with Chaucer; and so little money
had I then to spare for books, that, in all probability, but for this
same work, I should have known little of Drayton, Daniel, and other
distinguished poets of the Elizabethan age and their immediate
successors, till a much later period of my life. I am glad to record
this, not for any importance of its own, but as a tribute of gratitude
to this simple-hearted old man, whom I never again had the pleasure of
meeting. I seldom read or think of this poem without regretting that my
dear sister was not of the party, as she would have had so much delight
in recalling the time when, travelling together in Scotland, we declined
going in search of this celebrated stream, not altogether, I will
frankly confess, for the reasons assigned in the poem on the occasion.</p>

<p>This excellent Person, one of my earliest and dearest friends, died in
the year 1835. We were under-graduates together of the same year, at the
same college, and companions in many a delightful ramble through his own
romantic country of North Wales. Much of the latter part of his life he
passed in comparative solitude; which I know was often cheered by
remembrance of our youthful adventures, and of the beautiful regions
which, at home and abroad, we had visited together. Our long friendship
was never subject to a moment's interruption,&mdash;and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>{71}</span> while revising
these volumes for the last time, I have been so often reminded of my
loss, with a not unpleasing sadness, that I trust the Reader will excuse
this passing mention of a Man who well deserves from me something more
than so brief a notice. Let me only add, that during the middle part of
his life he resided many years (as Incumbent of the Living) at a
Parsonage in Oxfordshire, which is the subject of the seventh of the
'Miscellaneous Sonnets,' Part III.</p>

<p>In this and a succeeding Sonnet on the same subject, let me be
understood as a Poet availing himself of the situation which the King of
Sweden occupied, and of the principles AVOWED IN HIS MANIFESTOS; as
laying hold of these advantages for the purpose of embodying moral
truths. This remark might, perhaps, as well have been suppressed; for to
those who may be in sympathy with the course of these Poems, it will be
superfluous; and will, I fear, be thrown away upon that other class,
whose besotted admiration of the intoxicated despot hereafter placed in
contrast with him is the most melancholy evidence of degradation in
British feeling and intellect which the times have furnished.</p>

I could not but be struck, as here described, with the vanity and parade
of our own country, especially in great towns and cities, as contrasted

produced in France. This must be borne in mind, or else the reader may

mischief engendered and fostered among us by undisturbed wealth.</p>

a most venerable natural monument. Ferdinand and Isabella, in the year
1476, after hearing mass in the church of Santa Maria de la Antigua,
repaired to this tree, under which they swore to the Biscayans to
maintain their <i>fueros</i> (privileges). What other interest belongs to it
in the minds of the people will appear from the following 'Supposed
Address to the Same.'</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem268" id="poem268" ></a>268. <i>Thanksgiving Ode</i>. [Part II. XLVI.]</h3>

<p>Wholly unworthy of touching upon the momentous subject here treated
would that Poet be, before whose eyes the present distresses under which
this kingdom labours could interpose a veil sufficiently thick to hide,
or even to obscure, the splendour of this great moral triumph. If I have
given way to exultation, unchecked by these distresses, it might be
sufficient to protect me from a charge of insensibility, should I state
my own belief that the sufferings will be transitory. Upon the wisdom of
a very large majority of the British nation rested that generosity which
poured out the treasures of this country for the deliverance of Europe;
and in the same national wisdom, presiding in time of peace over an
energy not inferior to that which has been displayed in war, <i>they</i>
confide who encourage a firm hope that the cup of our wealth will be
gradually replenished. There will, doubtless, be no few ready to indulge
in regrets and repinings; and to feed a morbid satisfaction by
aggravating these burthens in imagination; in order that calamity so
confidently prophesied, as it has not taken the shape which their
sagacity allotted to it, may appear as grievous as possible under
another. But the body of the nation will not quarrel with the gain,
because it might have been purchased at a less price; and, acknowledging
in these sufferings, which they feel to have been in a great degree
unavoidable, a consecration of their noble efforts, they will vigorously
apply themselves to remedy the evil.</p>

<p>Nor is it at the expense of rational patriotism, or in disregard of
sound philosophy, that I have given vent to feelings tending to
encourage a martial spirit in the bosoms of my countrymen, at a time
when there is a general outcry against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>{74}</span> prevalence of these
dispositions. The British army, both by its skill and valour in the
field, and by the discipline which rendered it, to the inhabitants of
the several countries where its operations were carried on, a protection
from the violence of their own troops, has performed services that will
not allow the language of gratitude and admiration to be suppressed or
restrained (whatever be the temper of the public mind) through a
scrupulous dread lest the tribute due to the past should prove an
injurious incentive for the future. Every man deserving the name of
Briton adds his voice to the chorus which extols the exploits of his
countrymen, with a consciousness, at times overpowering the effort, that
they transcend all praise.&mdash;But this particular sentiment, thus
irresistibly excited, is not sufficient. The nation would err
grievously, if she suffered the abuse which other States have made of
military power to prevent her from perceiving that no people ever was or
can be independent, free, or secure, much less great, in any sane
application of the word, without a cultivation of military virtues. Nor
let it be overlooked, that the benefits derivable from these sources are
placed within the reach of Great Britain, under conditions peculiarly
favourable. The same insular position which, by rendering territorial
incorporation impossible, utterly precludes the desire of conquest under
the most seductive shape it can assume, enables her to rely, for her
defence against foreign foes, chiefly upon a species of armed force from
which her own liberties have nothing to fear. Such are the privileges of
her situation; and, by permitting, they invite her to give way to the
courageous instincts of human nature, and to strengthen and refine them
by culture.</p>

<p>But some have more than insinuated that a design exists to subvert the
civil character of the English people by unconstitutional applications
and unnecessary increase of military power. The advisers and abettors of
such a design, were it possible that it should exist, would be guilty of
the most heinous crime, which, upon this planet, can be committed.
Trusting that this apprehension arises from the delusive influences of
an honourable jealousy, let me hope that the martial qualities which I
venerate will be fostered by adhering to those good old usages which
experience has sanctioned; and by availing ourselves of new means of
indisputable promise: particularly by applying, in its utmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>{75}</span> possible
extent, that system of tuition whose master-spring is a habit of
gradually enlightened subordination;&mdash;by imparting knowledge, civil,
moral, and religious, in such measure that the mind, among all classes
of the community, may love, admire, and be prepared and accomplished to
defend, that country under whose protection its faculties have been
unfolded, and its riches acquired:&mdash;by just dealing towards all orders
of the State, so that no members of it being trampled upon, courage may
everywhere continue to rest immoveably upon its ancient English
foundation, personal self-respect;&mdash;by adequate rewards, and permanent
honours, conferred upon the deserving;&mdash;by encouraging athletic
exercises and manly sports among the peasantry of the country;&mdash;and by
especial care to provide and support institutions, in which, during a
time of peace, a reasonable proportion of the youth of the country may
be instructed in military science.</p>

<p>I have only to add, that I should feel little satisfaction in giving to
the world these limited attempts to celebrate the virtues of my country,
if I did not encourage a hope that a subject, which it has fallen within
my province to treat only in the mass, will by other poets be
illustrated in that detail which its importance calls for, and which
will allow opportunities to give the merited applause to PERSONS as well
as to THINGS.</p>

<p>The ode was published along with other pieces, now interspersed through
this Volume.</p>

<h3><a name="poem269" id="poem269" ></a>269. *<i>Ibid.</i></h3>

<p>The first stanza of this Ode was composed almost extempore, in front of
Rydal Mount before Church-time, on such a morning and precisely with
such objects before my eyes as are here described. The view taken of
Napoleon's character and proceedings is little in accordance with that
taken by some Historians and critical philosophers. I am glad and proud
of the difference, and trust that this series of Poems, infinitely below
the subject as they are, will survive to counteract in unsophisticated
minds the pernicious and degrading tendency of those views and doctrines
that lead to the idolatry of power as power, and in that false splendour
to lose sight of its real nature and constitution, as it often acts for
the gratification of its possessor without reference to a beneficial
end&mdash;an infirmity that has characterised men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>{76}</span> all ages, classes, and
employments, since Nimrod became a mighty hunter before the Lord, [In
pencil is the following by Mr. Quillinan&mdash;In a letter to Southey about
the rhythm of this Ode Wordsworth, comparing the first paragraph of the
'Aeneid' with that of the 'Jerusalem Liberated,' says, that 'the measure
of the latter has the pace of a set of recruits shuffling to vulgar
music upon a parade, and receiving from the adjutant or drill-sergeant
the command to halt at every twenty steps.' Mr. W. had no ear for
instrumental music; or he would not have applied this vulgar sarcasm to
military march-music. Besides, awkward recruits are never drilled to
music at all. The Band on parade plays to perfectly-drilled troops. Ne
sutor ultra crepidam.]</p>

<h3><a name="poem271" id="poem271" ></a>271. *<i>Introductory Remarks</i>.</h3>

<p>I set out in company with my wife and sister, and Mr. and Mrs.
Monkhouse, then just married, and Miss Horrocks. These two ladies,
sisters, we left at Berne, while Mr. Monkhouse took the opportunity of
making an excursion with us among the Alps, as far as Milan. Mr. H. C.
Robinson joined us at Lucerne, and when this ramble was completed we
rejoined at Geneva the two ladies we had left at Berne, and proceeded to
Paris, where Mr. Monkhouse and H. C. R. left us, and where we spent five
weeks, of which there is not a record in these poems.</p>

<h3><a name="poem272" id="poem272" ></a>272. <i>The Fishwomen of Calais</i>, [I.]</h3>

<p>If in this Sonnet [I. of 'Memorials of a Tour on the Continent,' 1820] I
should seem to have borne a little hard upon the personal appearance of
the worthy Poissardes of Calais, let me take shelter under the authority
of my lamented friend, the late Sir George Beaumont. He, a most accurate
observer, used to say of them, that their features and countenances
seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>{77}</span> have conformed to those of the creatures they dealt in; at
all events the resemblance was striking.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem273" id="poem273" ></a>273. *<i>Incident at Bruges</i>. [IV.]</h3>

<p>This occurred at Bruges in the year 1828. Mr. Coleridge, my daughter,
and I, made a tour together in Flanders, upon the Rhine, and returned by
Holland. Dora and I, while taking a walk along a retired part of the
town, heard the voice as here described, and were afterwards informed
that it was a convent, in which were many English. We were both much
touched, I might say affected, and Dora moved as appears in the verses.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem274" id="poem274" ></a>274. <i>Between Namur and Liege</i>. [VI.]</h3>

<p>The scenery on the Meuse pleases me more, upon the whole, than that of
the Rhine, though the river itself is much inferior in grandeur. The
rocks, both in form and colour, especially between Namur and Liege,
surpass any upon the Rhine, though they are in several places disfigured
by quarries, whence stones were taken for the new fortifications. This
is much to be regretted, for they are useless, and the scars will
remain, perhaps, for thousands of years. A like injury to a still
greater degree has been inflicted, in my memory, upon the beautiful
rocks at Clifton, on the banks of the Avon. There is probably in
existence a very long letter of mine to Sir Uvedale Price, in which was
given a description of the landscapes on the Meuse as compared with
those on the Rhine.</p>

<p>Details in the spirit of these sonnets are given both in Mary's Journal
and my sister's; and the reperusal of them has strengthened a wish long
entertained, that somebody would put together, as in one work, the notes
contained in them, omitting particulars that were written down merely to
aid our memory, and bringing the whole into as small a compass as is
consistent with the general interests belonging to the scenes,
circumstances, and objects touched on by each writer.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Not, like his great Compeers, indignantly<br /></span>
<span>Doth Danube spring to life!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Before this quarter of the Black Forest was inhabited, the source of the
Danube might have suggested some of those sublime images which Armstrong
has so finely described; at present, the contrast is most striking. The
Spring appears in a capacious stone Basin in front of a Ducal palace,
with a pleasure-ground opposite; then, passing under the pavement, takes
the form of a little, clear, bright, black, vigorous rill, barely wide
enough to tempt the agility of a child five years old to leap over
it,&mdash;and entering the garden, it joins, after a course of a few hundred
yards, a stream much more considerable than itself. The <i>copiousness</i> of
the spring at <i>Doneschingen</i> must have procured for it the honour of
being named the Source of the Danube.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem277" id="poem277" ></a>277. <i>The Staub-bach</i>. [XII.]</h3>

<p>'The Staub-bach' is a narrow Stream, which, after a long course on the
heights, comes to the sharp edge of a somewhat overhanging precipice,
overleaps it with a bound, and, after a fall of 930 feet, forms again a
rivulet. The vocal powers of these musical Beggars may seem to be
exaggerated; but this wild and savage air was utterly unlike any sounds
I had ever heard; the notes reached me from a distance, and on what
occasion they were sung I could not guess, only they seemed to belong,
in some way or other, to the Waterfall&mdash;and reminded me of religious
services chanted to Streams and Fountains in Pagan times. Mr. Southey
has thus accurately characterised the peculiarity of this music: 'While
we were at the Waterfall, some half-score peasants, chiefly women and
girls, assembled just out of reach of the Spring, and set up&mdash;surely,
the wildest chorus that ever was heard by human ears,&mdash;a song not of
articulate sounds, but in which the voice was used as a mere instrument
of music, more flexible than any which art could produce,&mdash;sweet,
powerful, and thrilling beyond description.'&mdash;See Notes to 'A Tale of
Paraguay.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>{79}</span></p>

the summit of which the Church is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>{80}</span> built, stands amid the intricacies of
the Lake of Lugano; and is, from a hundred points of view, its principal
ornament, rising to the height of 2000 feet, and, on one side, nearly
perpendicular. The ascent is toilsome; but the traveller who performs it
will be amply rewarded. Splendid fertility, rich woods and dazzling
waters, seclusion and confinement of view contrasted with sea-like
extent of plain fading into the sky; and this again, in an opposite
quarter, with an horizon of the loftiest and boldest Alps&mdash;unite in
composing a prospect more diversified by magnificence, beauty, and
sublimity, than perhaps any other point in Europe, of so inconsiderable
an elevation, commands.</p>

<p>The Statues ranged round the spire and along the roof of the Cathedral

unfortunate for themselves. It is true that the same expense and labour,
judiciously directed to purposes more<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>{81}</span> strictly architectural, might
have much heightened the general effect of the building; for, seen from
the ground, the Statues appear diminutive. But the <i>coup-d'oeil</i>, from
the best point of view, which is half way up the spire, must strike an
unprejudiced person with admiration; and surely the selection and
arrangement of the Figures is exquisitely fitted to support the religion
of the country in the imaginations and feelings of the spectator. It was
with great pleasure that I saw, during the two ascents which we made,
several children, of different ages, tripping up and down the slender
spire, and pausing to look around them, with feelings much more animated
than could have been derived from these or the finest works of art, if
placed within easy reach.&mdash;Remember also that you have the Alps on one
side, and on the other the Apennines, with the plain of Lombardy
between!</p>

<p>The lamented Youth whose untimely death gave occasion to these elegiac

was in his twentieth year, and had resided for some time with a
clergyman in the neighbourhood of Geneva for the completion of his
education. Accompanied by a fellow-pupil, a native of Scotland, he had
just set out on a Swiss tour when it was his misfortune to fall in with
a friend of mine who was hastening to join our party. The travellers,
after spending a day together on the road from Berne and at Soleure,
took leave of each other at night, the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>{82}</span> men having intended to
proceed directly to Zurich. But early in the morning my friend found his
new acquaintances, who were informed of the object of his journey, and
the friends he was in pursuit of, equipped to accompany him. We met at
Lucerne the succeeding evening, and Mr. G. and his fellow-student became
in consequence our travelling companions for a couple of days. We
ascended the Righi together; and, after contemplating the sunrise from
that noble mountain, we separated at an hour and on a spot well suited
to the parting of those who were to meet no more. Our party descended
through the valley of our Lady of the Snow, and our late companions, to
Art. We had hoped to meet in a few weeks at Geneva; but on the third
succeeding day (on the 21st of August) Mr. Goddard perished, being
overset in a boat while crossing the lake of Zurich. His companion saved
himself by swimming, and was hospitably received in the mansion of a
Swiss gentleman (M. Keller) situated on the eastern coast of the lake.
The corpse of poor Goddard was cast ashore on the estate of the same
gentleman, who generously performed all the rites of hospitality which
could be rendered to the dead as well as to the living. He caused a
handsome mural monument to be erected in the church of K&uuml;snacht, which
records the premature fate of the young American, and on the shores too
of the lake the traveller may read an inscription pointing out the spot
where the body was deposited by the waves.</p>

with their creatures, to the frontiers, after having witnessed the
destruction of their strong-holds. From that time the Landenberg has
been the place where the Legislators of this division of the Canton
assemble. The site, which is well described by Ebel, is one of the most

<br />
<h3><a name="poem295" id="poem295" ></a>295. *<i>Introductory Remarks</i>.</h3>

<p>During my whole life I had felt a strong desire to visit Rome and the
other celebrated cities and regions of Italy, but did not think myself
justified in incurring the necessary expense till I received from Mr.
Moxon, the publisher of a large edition of my poems, a sum sufficient to
enable me to gratify my wish without encroaching upon what I considered
due to my family. My excellent friend H.C. Robinson readily consented to
accompany me, and in March 1837 we set off from London, to which we
returned in August&mdash;earlier than my companion wished, or I should myself
have desired, had I been, like him, a bachelor. These Memorials of that
Tour touch upon but a very few of the places and objects that interested
me; and in what they do advert to are for the most part much slighter
than I could wish. More particularly do I regret that there is no notice
in them of the south of France, nor of the Roman antiquities abounding
in that district; especially of the Pont de Degard, which, together with
its situation, impressed me full as much as any remains of Roman
architecture to be found in Italy. Then there was Vaucluse, with its
fountain, its Petrarch, its rocks [query&mdash;roses?] of all seasons, its
small plots of lawn in their first vernal freshness, and the blossoms of
the peach and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>{85}</span> trees embellishing the scene on every side. The
beauty of the stream also called forcibly for the expression of sympathy
from one who from his childhood had studied the brooks and torrents of
his native mountains. Between two and three hours did I run about,
climbing the steep and rugged craggs, from whose base the water of
Vaucluse breaks forth. 'Has Laura's lover,' often said I to myself,
'ever sat down upon this stone? Or has his foot ever pressed that turf?'
Some, especially of the female sex, could have felt sure of it; my
answer was (impute it to my years), 'I fear, not.' Is it not in fact
obvious that many of his love-verses must have flowed, I do not say from
a wish to display his own talent, but from a habit of exercising his
intellect in that way, rather than from an impulse of his heart? It is
otherwise with his Lyrical Poems, and particularly with the one upon the
degradation of his country. There he pours out his reproaches,
lamentations, and aspirations like an ardent and sincere patriot. But
enough; it is time to turn to my own effusions, such as they are.</p>


<br />

was shortened by report, too well founded, of the prevalence of cholera
at Naples. To make some amends for what was reluctantly left unseen in
the south of Italy, we visited the Tuscan Sanctuaries among the
Apennines, and the principal Italian Lakes among the Alps. Neither of
those lakes, nor of Venice, is there any notice in these poems, chiefly
because I have touched upon them elsewhere. See in particular
'Descriptive Sketches,' 'Memorials of a Tour on the Continent in 1820,'
and a Sonnet upon the extinction of the Venetian Republic.</p>

<h3><a name="poem297" id="poem297" ></a>297. *<i>Musings at Aquapendente, April </i>1837. [I.]</h3>

<p>The following note refers to Sir W. Scott:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Had his sunk eye kindled at those dear words<br /></span>
<span>That spake of Bards and Minstrels' (ll. 60-1).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>His</i>, Sir W. Scott's, eye <i>did</i> in fact kindle at them, for the lines
'Places forsaken now,' and the two that follow, were adopted from a poem
of mine, which nearly forty years ago was in part read to him, and he
never forgot them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>{86}</span></p>

</div></div>

<p>Sir Hy. Davy was with us at the time. We had ascended from Paterdale,
and I could not but admire the vigour with which Scott scrambled along
that horn of the mountain called 'Striding Edge.' Our progress was
necessarily slow, and beguiled by Scott's telling many stories and
amusing anecdotes, as was his custom. Sir H. Davy would have probably
been better pleased if other topics had occasionally been interspersed
and some discussion entered upon; at all events, he did not remain with
us long at the top of the mountain, but left us to find our way down its
steep side together into the vale of Grasmere, where at my cottage Mrs.
Scott was to meet us at dinner. He said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'When I am there, although 'tis fair,<br /></span>
<span>'Twill be another Yarrow.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>See among these Notes the one upon Yarrow Revisited. [In the printed
Notes there is the following farther reference to the touching quotation
by Scott&mdash;These words were quoted to me from 'Yarrow Unvisited' by Sir
Walter Scott, when I visited him at Abbotsford, a day or two before his
departure for Italy; and the affecting condition in which he was when he
looked upon Rome from the Janicular Mount was reported to me by a lady
who had the honour of conducting him thither.]</p>

<p>This, though introduced here, I did not know till it was told me at Rome
by Miss Mackenzie of Seaforth, a lady whose friendly attentions, during
my residence at Rome, I have gratefully acknowledged with expressions of
sincere regret that she is no more. Miss M. told me that she had
accompanied Sir Walter to the Janicular Mount, and, after showing him
the grave of Tasso in the church upon the top, and a mural monument
there erected to his memory, they left the church, and stood together on
the brow of the hill overlooking the city of Rome. His daughter Anne was
with them, and she, naturally desirous, for the sake of Miss Mackenzie
especially, to have some expression of pleasure from her father, half
reproached<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>{87}</span> him for showing nothing of that kind either by his looks or
voice. 'How can I,' replied he, 'having only one leg to stand upon, and

<h3><a name="poem299" id="poem299" ></a>299. '<i>Over waves rough and deep</i>' (line 122).</h3>

<p>We took boat near the lighthouse at the point of the right horn of the
bay, which makes a sort of natural port for Genoa; but the wind was
high, and the waves long and rough, so that I did not feel quite
recompensed by the view of the city, splendid as it was, for the danger
apparently incurred. The boatman (I had only one) encouraged me, saying,
we were quite safe; but I was not a little glad when we gained the
shore, though Shelley and Byron&mdash;one of them at least who seemed to have
courted agitation from every quarter&mdash;would have probably rejoiced in
such a situation. More than once, I believe, were they both in extreme
danger even on the Lake of Geneva. Every man, however, has his fears of
some kind or other, and, no doubt, they had theirs. Of all men whom I
have ever known, Coleridge had the most of passive courage in bodily
trial, but no one was so easily cowed when moral firmness was required
in miscellaneous conversation or in the daily intercourse of social
life.</p>

<p>There is not a single bay along this beautiful coast that might not
raise in a traveller a wish to take up his abode there; each as it
succeeds seems more inviting than the other; but the desolated convent
on the cliff in the bay of Savona struck my fancy most; and had I, for
the sake of my own health or of that of a dear friend, or any other
cause, been desirous of a residence abroad, I should have let my
thoughts loose upon a scheme of turning some part of this building into
a habitation, provided as far as might be with English comforts. There
is close by it a row, or avenue (I forget which), of tall cypresses. I
could not forbear saying to myself, 'What a sweet family walk, or one
for lonely musings, would be found under the shade!' but there probably
the trees remain little noticed and seldom enjoyed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>{88}</span></p>

<h3><a name="poem301" id="poem301" ></a>301. '<i>This flowering Broom's dear Neighbourhood</i>' (l. 378). p/</h3>

<p>The Broom is a great ornament through the months of March and April to
the vales and hills of the Apennines, in the wild part of which it blows
in the utmost profusion, and of course successively at different
elevations as the season advances. It surpasses ours in beauty and
fragrance; but, speaking from my own limited observation only, I cannot
affirm the same of several of their wild Spring flowers, the primroses
in particular, which I saw not unfrequently but thinly scattered and
languishing as compared with ours.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem302" id="poem302" ></a>302. <i>The Religious Movement in the English Church</i>.</h3>

<p>In the printed Notes there is the following on Aquapendente: 'It would
be ungenerous not to advert to the religious movement that, since the
composition of these verses in 1837, has made itself felt, more or less
strongly, throughout the English Church; a movement that takes for its
first principle a devout deference to the voice of Christian antiquity.
It is not my office to pass judgment on questions of theological detail;
but my own repugnance to the spirit and system of Romanism has been so
repeatedly, and I trust feelingly, expressed that I shall not be
suspected of a leaning that way, if I do not join in the grave charges,
thrown out, perhaps, in the heat of controversy, against the learned and
pious men to whose labours I allude. I speak apart from controversy, but
with a strong faith in the moral temper which would elevate the present
by doing reverence to the past. I would draw cheerful auguries for the
English Church from this movement as likely to restore among us a tone
of piety more earnest and real than that produced by the mere
formalities of the understanding, refusing, in a degree which I cannot
but lament, that its own temper and judgment shall be controlled by
those of antiquity.' From the I.F. MSS. we learn that the preceding note
was written by the Rev. F.W. Faber, D.D., as thus: 'The Note at the
close of the poem upon the Oxford movement was intrusted to my friend
Mr. Frederick Faber. I told him what I wished to be said, and begged
that as he was intimately acquainted with several of the Leaders of it,
he would express my thought in the way least likely to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>{89}</span> taken amiss
by them. Much of the work they are undertaking was grievously wanted,
and God grant their endeavours may continue to prosper as they have
done.'</p>

<h3><a name="poem302a" id="poem302a" ></a>302a. *'<i>The Pine-tree of Monte Mario</i>,' [II.]</h3>

<p>Rescued by Sir G. Beaumont from destruction. Sir G. Beaumont told me
that when he first visited Italy, pine-trees of this species abounded;
but that on his return thither, which was more than thirty years after,
they had disappeared from many places where he had been accustomed to
admire them, and had become rare all over the country, especially in and
about Rome. Several Roman villas have within these few years passed into
the hands of foreigners, who, I observed with pleasure, have taken care
to plant this tree, which in course of years will become a great
ornament to the city and to the general landscape.</p>

<p>May I venture to add here, that having ascended the Monte Mario I could
not resist embracing the trunk of this interesting monument of my
departed friend's feelings for the beauties of nature and the power of
that art which he loved so much and in the practice of which he was so
distinguished.</p>

<p>[Among the printed Notes is the following&mdash;Within a couple of hours of
my arrival at Rome, I saw from Monte Pincio the Pine-tree as described
in the Sonnet; and while expressing admiration at the beauty of its
appearance, I was told by an acquaintance of my fellow-traveller, who
happened to join us at the moment, that a price had been paid for it by
the late Sir G. Beaumont, upon condition that the proprietor should not
act upon his known intention of cutting it down.]</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem303" id="poem303" ></a>303. '<i>Is this, ye gods</i>.' [III. l. 1.]</h3>

<p>Sight is at first a sad enemy to imagination, and to those pleasures
belonging to old times with which some exertions of that power will
always mingle. Nothing perhaps brings this truth home to the feelings
more than the city of Rome, not so much in respect to the impression
made at the moment when it is first seen and looked at as a whole, for
then the imagination may be invigorated, and the mind's eye quickened to
perceive as much as that of the imagination; but when <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>{90}</span>particular spots
or objects are sought out, disappointment is, I believe, invariably
felt. Ability to recover from this disappointment will exist in
proportion to knowledge, and the power of the mind to reconstruct out of
fragments and parts, and to make details in the present subservient to
more adequate comprehension of the past.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'They who have seen the noble Roman's scorn.' [VII. l. 1.]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I have a private interest in this sonnet, for I doubt whether it would
ever have been written, but for the lively picture given me by Anna
Ricketts of what they had witnessed of the indignation and sorrow
expressed by some Italian noblemen of their acquaintance upon the
surrender, which circumstances had obliged them to make, of the best
portion of their family mansions to strangers.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem305" id="poem305" ></a>305. *<i>At Albano</i>. [IX]</h3>

<p>This sonnet is founded on simple fact, and was written to enlarge, if
possible, the views of those who can see nothing but evil in the
intercessions countenanced by the Church of Rome. That they are in many
respects lamentably pernicious must be acknowledged; but, on the other
hand, they who reflect while they see and observe cannot but be struck
with instances which will prove that it is a great error to condemn in
all cases such mediation, as purely idolatrous. This remark bears with
especial force upon addresses to the Virgin.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem306" id="poem306" ></a>306. *<i>Cuckoo at Laverna</i>. [XIV.]</h3>

<p>May 25th, 1837. Among a thousand delightful feelings connected in my
mind with the voice of the cuckoo, there is a personal one which is
rather melancholy. I was first convinced that age had rather dulled my
hearing, by not being able to catch the sound at the same distance as
the younger companions of my walks; and of this failure I had proof upon
the occasion that suggested these verses. I did not hear the sound till
Mr. Robinson had twice or thrice directed my attention to it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>{91}</span></p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem307" id="poem307" ></a>307. <i>Camaldoli</i>. [XV.]</h3>

<p>This famous sanctuary was the original establishment of Saint Romualdo,
(or Rumwald, as our ancestors saxonised the name) in the 11th century,
the ground (campo) being given by a Count Maldo. The Camaldolensi,
however, have spread wide as a branch of Benedictines, and may therefore
be classed among the <i>gentlemen</i> of the monastic orders. The society
comprehends two orders, monks and hermits; symbolised by their arms, two
doves drinking out of the same cup. The monastery in which the monks
here reside is beautifully situated, but a large unattractive edifice,
not unlike a factory. The hermitage is placed in a loftier and wilder
region of the forest. It comprehends between 20 and 30 distinct
residences, each including for its single hermit an inclosed piece of
ground and three very small apartments. There are days of indulgence
when the hermit may quit his cell, and when old age arrives, he descends
from the mountain and takes his abode among the monks.</p>

<p>My companion had, in the year 1831, fallen in with the monk, the subject
of these two sonnets, who showed him his abode among the hermits. It is
from him that I received the following particulars. He was then about 40
years of age, but his appearance was that of an older man. He had been a
painter by profession, but on taking orders changed his name from Santi
to Raffaello, perhaps with an unconscious reference as well to the great
Sanzio d'Urbino as to the archangel. He assured my friend that he had
been 13 years in the hermitage and had never known melancholy or ennui.
In the little recess for study and prayer, there was a small collection
of books. 'I read only,' said he, 'books of asceticism and mystical
theology.' On being asked the names of the most famous mystics, he
enumerated <i>Scaramelli, San Giovanni della Croce, St. Dionysius the
Areopayite</i> (supposing the work which bears his name to be really his),
and with peculiar emphasis <i>Ricardo di San Vittori</i>. The works of <i>Saint
Theresa </i>are also in high repute among ascetics. These names may
interest some of my readers.</p>

<p>We heard that Raffaello was then living in the convent; my friend sought
in vain to renew his acquaintance with him. It was probably a day of
seclusion. The reader will perceive that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>{92}</span> these sonnets were supposed to
be written when he was a young man.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem308" id="poem308" ></a>308. <i>Monk-visitors of Camaldoli</i>.</h3>

<div class="center">'What aim had they the pair of Monks?' (XVII. l. 1.)</div>

<p>In justice to the Benedictines of Camaldoli, by whom strangers are so
hospitably entertained, I feel obliged to notice, that I saw among them
no other figures at all resembling, in size and complexion, the two
monks described in this Sonnet. What was their office, or the motive
which brought them to this place of mortification, which they could not
have approached without being carried in this or some other way, a
feeling of delicacy prevented me from inquiring. An account has before
been given of the hermitage they were about to enter. It was visited by
us towards the end of the month of May; yet snow was lying thick under
the pine-trees, within a few yards of the gate.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem309" id="poem309" ></a>309. *<i>At Vallombrosa</i>. [XVIII.]</h3>

<p>I must confess, though of course I did not acknowledge it in the few
lines I wrote in the strangers' book kept at the Convent, that I was
somewhat disappointed at Vallombrosa. I had expected, as the name
implies, a deep and narrow valley, over-shadowed by enclosing hills: but
the spot where the convent stands is in fact not a valley at all, but a
cove or crescent open to an extensive prospect. In the book before
mentioned I read the notice in the English language, that if any one
would ascend the steep ground above the convent, and wander over it, he
would be abundantly rewarded by magnificent views. I had not time to act
upon the recommendation, and only went with my young guide to a point,
nearly on a level with the site of the convent, that overlooks the Vale
of Arno for some leagues.</p>

<p>To praise great and good men has ever been deemed one of the worthiest
employments of poetry; but the objects of admiration vary so much with
time and circumstances, and the noblest of mankind have been found, when
intimately known, to be of characters so imperfect, that no eulogist can
find a subject which he will venture upon with the animation necessary
to create sympathy, unless he confines himself to a particular act, or
he takes something of a one-sided view of the person he is disposed to
celebrate. This is a melancholy truth, and affords a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>{93}</span> reason for
the poetic mind being chiefly exercised in works of fiction. The poet
can then follow wherever the spirit of admiration leads him, unchecked
by such suggestions as will be too apt to cross his way if all that he
is prompted to utter is to be tested by fact. Something in this spirit I
have written in the note attached to the Sonnet on the King of Sweden;
and many will think that in this poem, and elsewhere, I have spoken of
the author of 'Paradise Lost' in a strain of panegyric scarcely
justifiable by the tenour of some of his opinions, whether theological
or political, and by the temper he carried into public affairs, in
which, unfortunately for his genius, he was so much concerned.</p>

<p>[Among the printed Notes is this&mdash;The name of Milton is pleasingly
connected with Vallombrosa in many ways. The pride with which the Monk,
without any previous question from me, pointed out his residence, I
shall not readily forget. It may be proper here to defend the Poet from
a charge which has been brought against him, in respect to the passage
in 'Paradise Lost' where this place is mentioned. It is said, that he
has erred in speaking of the trees there being deciduous, whereas they
are, in fact, pines. The fault-finders are themselves mistaken: the
natural woods of the region of Vallombrosa are deciduous and spread to a
great extent; those near the convent are, indeed, mostly pines; but they
are avenues of trees planted within a few steps of each other, and thus
composing large tracts of wood, plots of which are periodically cut
down. The appearance of those narrow avenues, upon steep slopes open to
the sky, on account of the height which the trees attain by being forced
to grow upwards, is often very impressive. My guide, a boy of about
fourteen years old, pointed this out to me in several places.]</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem310" id="poem310" ></a>310. *<i>Sonnet at Florence</i>. [XIX.]</h3>

<div class="center">'Under the shadow of a stately pile.'</div>

<p>Upon what evidence the belief rests that this stone was a favourite seat
of Dante, I do not know; but a man would little consult his own interest
as a traveller, if he should busy himself with doubts as to the fact.
The readiness with which traditions of this character are received, and
the fidelity with which they are preserved from generation to
generation, are an evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>{94}</span> feelings honourable to our nature. I
remember now, during one of my rambles in the course of a college
vacation, I was pleased at being shown at &mdash;&mdash; a seat near a kind of
rocky cell at the source of the river &mdash;&mdash;, on which it was said that
Congreve wrote his <i>Old Bachelor</i>. One can scarcely hit on any
performance less in harmony with the scene; but it was a local tribute
paid to intellect by those who had not troubled themselves to estimate
the moral worth of that author's comedies. And why should they? he was a
man distinguished in his day, and the sequestered neighbourhood in which
he often resided was perhaps as proud of him as Florence of her Dante.
It is the same feeling, though proceeding from persons one cannot bring
together in this way without offering some apology to the shade of the
great visionary.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem311" id="poem311" ></a>311. *<i>The Baptist</i>. [XX.]</h3>

<p>It was very hot weather during the week we stayed at Florence; and,
having never been there before, I went through much hard service, and am
not, therefore, <i>ashamed</i> to confess, I fell asleep before this picture,
and sitting with my back towards the Venus de Medicis. Buonaparte, in
answer to one who had spoken of his being in a sound sleep up to the
moment when one of his great battles was to be fought, as a proof of the
calmness of his mind and command over anxious thoughts, said frankly,
'that he slept because, from bodily exhaustion, he could not help it.'
In like manner it is noticed that criminals, on the night previous to
their execution, seldom awake before they are called, a proof that the
body is the master of us far more than we need be willing to allow.</p>

<p>Should this note by any possible chance be seen by any of my countrymen
who might have been in the Gallery at the time (and several persons were
there) and witnessed such an indecorum, I hope he will give up the
opinion which he might naturally have formed to my prejudice.</p>

<h3><a name="poem312" id="poem312" ></a>312. *<i>Florence</i>.</h3>

<div class="center">'Rapt above earth,' and the following one. [XXI.-II.]</div>

<p>However, at first, these two Sonnets from M. Angelo may seem in their
spirit somewhat inconsistent with each other, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>{95}</span> have not scrupled to
place them side by side as characteristic of their great author, and
others with whom he lived. I feel, nevertheless, a wish to know at what
periods of his life they were respectively composed. The latter, as it
expresses, was written in his advanced years, when it was natural that
the Platonism that pervades the one should give way to the Christian
feeling that inspired the other. Between both, there is more than poetic
affinity.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem312a" id="poem312a" ></a>312a. *<i>Among the Ruins of a Convent in the Apennines</i>. [XXIII.]</h3>

<p>The political revolutions of our time have multiplied on the Continent
objects that unavoidably call forth reflections such as are expressed in
these verses, but the ruins in those countries are too recent to exhibit
in anything like an equal degree the beauty with which time and Nature
have invested the remains of our convents and abbeys. These verses, it
will be observed, take up the beauty long before it is matured, as one
cannot but wish it may be among some of the desolations of Italy,
France, and Germany.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem313" id="poem313" ></a>313. *<i>Sonnets after leaving Italy</i>. [XXV.]</h3>

<p>I had proof in several instances that the Carbonari, if I may still call
them so, and their favourers, are opening their eyes to the necessity of
patience, and are intent upon spreading knowledge actively, but quietly
as they can. May they have resolution to continue in this course, for it
is the only one by which they can truly benefit their country.</p>

<p>We left Italy by the way which is called the 'Nuova Strada d'Allemagna,'
to the east of the high passes of the Alps, which take you at once from
Italy into Switzerland. The road leads across several smaller heights,
and winds down different vales in succession, so that it was only by the
accidental sound of a few German words I was aware we had quitted Italy;
and hence the unwelcome shock alluded to in the two or three last lines
of the Sonnet with which this imperfect series concludes.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem314" id="poem314" ></a>314. *<i>Composed at Rydal on May morning</i>, 1838.</h3>

<p>This and the following Sonnet [now XXVI.] were composed on what we call
the 'far terrace' at Rydal Mount, where I have murmured out many
thousands of my verses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>{96}</span></p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem315" id="poem315" ></a>315. *<i>Pillar of Trajan</i>. [XXVIII.]</h3>

<p>These verses had better, perhaps, be transferred to the class of
'Italian Poems.' I had observed in the newspaper that 'The Pillar of
Trajan' was given as a subject for a Prize Poem in English verse. I had
a wish, perhaps, that my son, who was then an undergraduate at Oxford,
should try his fortune; and I told him so: but he, not having been
accustomed to write verse, wisely declined to enter on the task;
whereupon I showed him these lines as a proof of what might, without
difficulty, be done on such a subject.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem316" id="poem316" ></a>316. *<i>The Egyptian Maid</i>.</h3>

<p>In addition to the short notice prefixed to this poem, it may be worth
while here to say, that it rose out of a few words casually used in
conversation by my nephew Henry Hutchinson. He was describing with great
spirit the appearance and movement of a vessel which he seemed to admire
more than any other he had ever seen, and said her name was the Water
Lily. This plant has been my delight from my boyhood, as I have seen it
floating on the lake; and that conversation put me upon constructing and
composing the poem. Had I not heard those words it would never have been
written. The form of the stanza is new, and is nothing but a repetition
of the first five lines as they were thrown off, and is, perhaps, not
well suited to narrative, and certainly would not have been trusted to
had I thought at the beginning that the poem would have gone to such a
length. [The short note referred to <i>supra</i> is as follows: 'For the
names and persons in the following poem see the <i>History of the Renowned
Prince Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table</i>; for the rest the
author is answerable; only it may be proper to add that the Lotus, with
the bust of the goddess appearing to rise out of the full-blown flower,
was suggested by the beautiful work of ancient art once included among
the Townley Marbles, and now in the British Museum.']</p>

boundary to the two last counties for the space of about twenty-five
miles, enters the Irish Sea, between the Isle of Walney and the Lordship
of Millum.</p>

<p>No one believes, or is desired to believe, that those Poems were
actually composed within such limits of time; nor was there any reason
why a prose statement should acquaint the Reader with the plain fact, to
the disturbance of poetic credibility. But, in the present case, I am
compelled to mention, that the above series of Sonnets was the growth of
many years;&mdash;the one which stands the 14th was the first produced; and
others were added upon occasional visits to the Stream, or as
recollections of the scenes upon its banks awakened a wish to describe
them. In this manner I had proceeded insensibly, without perceiving that
I was trespassing upon ground pre-occupied, at least as far as intention
went, by Mr. Coleridge; who, more than twenty years ago, used to speak
of writing a rural Poem, to be entitled 'The Brook,' of which he has
given a sketch in a recent publication. But a particular subject cannot,
I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>{98}</span> think, much interfere with a general one; and I have been further
kept from encroaching upon any right Mr. C. may still wish to exercise,
by the restriction which the frame of the Sonnet imposed upon me,
narrowing unavoidably the range of thought, and precluding, though not
without its advantages, many graces to which a freer movement of verse
would naturally have led.</p>

<p>May I not venture, then, to hope, that, instead of being a hindrance, by
anticipation of any part of the subject, these Sonnets may remind Mr.
Coleridge of his own more comprehensive design, and induce him to fulfil
it?&mdash;There is a sympathy in streams,&mdash;'one calleth to another;' and I
would gladly believe, that 'The Brook' will, ere long, murmur in concert
with 'The Duddon.' But, asking pardon for this fancy, I need not scruple
to say, that those verses must indeed be ill-fated which can enter upon
such pleasant walks of Nature, without receiving and giving inspiration.
The power of waters over the minds of Poets has been acknowledged from
the earliest ages;&mdash;through the 'Flumina amem sylvasque inglorius' of
Virgil, down to the sublime apostrophe to the great rivers of the earth,
by Armstrong, and the simple ejaculation of Burns, (chosen, if I
recollect right, by Mr. Coleridge, as a motto for his embryo 'Brook,')&mdash;</p>

<h3><a name="poem319" id="poem319" ></a>319. *<i>The Sonnets on the River Duddon</i>.</h3>

<p>It is with the little River Duddon as it is with most other rivers,
Ganges and Nile not excepted,&mdash;many springs might claim the honour of
being its head. In my own fancy, I have fixed its rise near the noted
Shire Stones placed at the meeting point of the counties Westmoreland,
Cumberland, and Lancashire. They stand by the wayside, on the top of the
Wrynose Pass, and it used to be reckoned a proud thing to say, that by
touching them at the same time with feet and hands, one had been in
three counties at once. At what point of its course the stream takes the
name of Duddon, I do not know. I first became acquainted with the
Duddon, as I have good reason to remember, in early boyhood. Upon the
banks of the Derwent, I had learnt to be very fond of angling. Fish
abound in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>{99}</span> large river,&mdash;not so in the small streams in the
neighbourhood of Hawkshead; and I fell into the common delusion, that
the farther from home the better sport would be had. Accordingly, one
day I attached myself to a person living in the neighbourhood of
Hawkshead, who was going to try his fortune, as an angler, near the
source of the Duddon. We fished a great part of the day with very sorry
success, the rain pouring torrents; and long before we got home, I was
worn out with fatigue; and if the good man had not carried me on his
back, I must have lain down under the best shelter I could find. Little
did I think then it would have been my lot to celebrate, in a strain of
love and admiration, the stream which for many years I never thought of
without recollections of disappointment and distress.</p>

<p>During my college vacation, and two or three years afterwards, before
taking my bachelor's degree, I was several times resident in the house
of a near relative, who lived in the small town of Broughton. I passed
many delightful hours upon the banks of this river, which becomes an
estuary about a mile from that place. The remembrances of that period
are the subject of the 21st Sonnet. The subject of the 27th Sonnet is,
in fact, taken from a tradition belonging to Rydal Hall, which once
stood, as is believed, upon a rocky and woody hill on the right hand as
you go from Rydal to Ambleside, and was deserted, from the superstitious
fear here described, and the present site fortunately chosen instead.
The present Hall was erected by Sir Michael le Fleming, and it may be
hoped that at some future time there will be an edifice more worthy of
so beautiful a position. With regard to the 30th Sonnet, it is odd
enough that this imagination was realised in the year 1840, when I made
a tour through this district with my wife and daughter, Miss Fenwick and
her niece, and Mr. and Miss Quillinan. Before our return from Seathwaite
Chapel, the party separated. Mrs. Wordsworth, while most of us went
further up the stream, chose an opposite direction, having told us that
we would overtake her on our way to Ulpha. But she was tempted out of
the main road to ascend a rocky eminence near it, thinking it impossible
we should pass without seeing her. This however unfortunately happened;
and then ensued vexation and distress, especially to me, which I should
be ashamed to have recorded, for I lost my temper entirely. Neither I
nor those who were with me saw her again till we<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>{100}</span> reached the Inn at
Broughton, seven miles. This may perhaps in some degree excuse my
irritability on the occasion, for I could not but think she had been
much to blame. It appeared, however, on explanation, that she had
remained on the rock, calling out and waving her handkerchief as we were
passing, in order that we also might ascend and enjoy a prospect which
had much charmed her. 'But on we went, her signals proving vain.' How
then could she reach Broughton before us? When we found she had not gone
on to Ulpha Kirk, Mr. Quillinan went back in one of the carriages in
search of her. He met her on the road, took her up, and by a shorter way
conveyed her to Broughton, where we were all re-united and spent a happy
evening.</p>

<p>I have many affecting remembrances connected with this stream. These I
forbear to mention, especially things that occurred on its banks during
the latter part of that visit to the sea-side, of which the former part
is detailed in my Epistle to Sir George Beaumont.</p>

<p>[The following additional notices of his latter excursion to the banks
of the Duddon are from a letter to Lady Frederick Bentinck.</p>

<p>'You will have wondered, dear Lady Frederick, what is become of me. I
have been wandering about the country, and only returned yesterday. Our
tour was by Keswick, Scale Hill, Buttermere, Loweswater, Ennerdale,
Calder Abbey, Wastdale, Eskdale, the Vale of Duddon, Broughton, Furness
Abbey, Peele Castle, Ulverston, &amp;c.; we had broken weather, which kept
us long upon the road, but we had also very fine intervals, and I often
wished you had been present. We had such glorious sights! one, in
particular, I never saw the like of. About sunset we were directly
opposite that large, lofty precipice at Wastwater, which is called the
Screes. The ridge of it is broken into sundry points, and along them,
and partly along the side of the steep, went driving a procession of
yellow vapoury clouds from the sea-quarter towards the mountain
Scawfell. Their colours I have called yellow, but it was exquisitely
varied, and the shapes of the rocks on the summit of the ridge varied
with the density or thinness of the vapours. The effect was most
enchanting; for right above was steadfastly fixed a beautiful rainbow.
We were a party of seven, Mrs. Wordsworth, my daughter, and Miss Fenwick
included, and it would be difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>{101}</span> to say who was most delighted. The
Abbey of Furness, as you well know, is a noble ruin, and most happily
situated in a dell that entirely hides it from the surrounding country.
It is taken excellent care of, and seems little dilapidated since I
first knew it, more than half a century ago.]<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>These two lines are in a great measure taken from 'The Beauties of
Spring, a Juvenile Poem,' by the Rev. Joseph Sympson. He was a native of
Cumberland, and was educated in the vale of Grasmere, and at Hawkshead
school: his poems are little known, but they contain passages of
splendid description; and the versification of his 'Vision of Alfred' is
harmonious and animated. In describing the motions of the Sylphs, that
constitute the strange machinery of his Poem, he uses the following
illustrative simile:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&mdash;'Glancing from their plumes<br /></span>
<span>A changeful light the azure vault illumes.<br /></span>
<span>Less varying hues beneath the Pole adorn<br /></span>
<span>The streamy glories of the Boreal morn,<br /></span>
<span>That wavering to and fro their radiance shed<br /></span>
<span>On Bothnia's gulf with glassy ice o'erspread,<br /></span>
<span>Where the lone native, as he homeward glides,<br /></span>
<span>On polished sandals o'er the imprisoned tides,<br /></span>
<span>And still the balance of his frame preserves,<br /></span>
<span>Wheeled on alternate foot in lengthening curves,<br /></span>
<span>Sees at a glance, above him and below,<br /></span>
<span>Two rival heavens with equal splendour glow.<br /></span>

<span>For all around with soft effulgence gleams;<br /></span>
<span>Stars, moons, and meteors, ray opposed to ray,<br /></span>
<span>And solemn midnight pours the blaze of day.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He was a man of ardent feeling, and his faculties of mind, particularly
his memory, were extraordinary. Brief notices of his life ought to find
a place in the History of Westmoreland.</p>

<h3><a name="poem321" id="poem321" ></a>321. '<i>Return' and 'Seathwaite Chapel</i>.' [Sonnets XVII. and XVIII.]</h3>

<p>The EAGLE requires a large domain for its support: but several pairs,
not many years ago, were constantly resident in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>{102}</span> this country, building
their nests in the steeps of Borrowdale, Wastdale, Ennerdale, and on the
eastern side of Helvellyn. Often have I heard anglers speak of the
grandeur of their appearance, as they hovered over Red Tarn, in one of
the coves of this mountain. The bird frequently returns, but is always
destroyed. Not long since, one visited Rydal lake, and remained some
hours near its banks: the consternation which it occasioned among the
different species of fowl, particularly the herons, was expressed by
loud screams. The horse also is naturally afraid of the eagle.&mdash;There
were several Roman stations among these mountains; the most considerable
seems to have been in a meadow at the head of Windermere, established,
undoubtedly, as a check over the Passes of Kirkstone, Dunmailraise, and
of Hardknot and Wrynose. On the margin of Rydal lake, a coin of Trajan
was discovered very lately.&mdash;The ROMAN FORT here alluded to, called by
the country people '<i>Hardknot Castle</i>,' is most impressively situated
half-way down the hill on the right of the road that descends from
Hardknot into Eskdale. It has escaped the notice of most antiquarians,
and is but slightly mentioned by Lysons.&mdash;The DRUIDICAL CIRCLE is about
half a mile to the left of the road ascending Stone-side from the vale
of Duddon: the country people call it '<i>Sunken Church</i>.'</p>

<p>The reader who may have been interested in the foregoing Sonnets, (which
together may be considered as a Poem,) will not be displeased to find in
this place a prose account of the Duddon, extracted from Green's
comprehensive <i>Guide to the Lakes</i>, lately published. 'The road leading
from Coniston to Broughton is over high ground, and commands a view of
the River Duddon; which, at high water, is a grand sight, having the
beautiful and fertile lands of Lancashire and Cumberland stretching each
way from its margin. In this extensive view, the face of Nature is
displayed in a wonderful variety of hill and dale; wooded grounds and
buildings; amongst the latter Broughton Tower, seated on the crown of a
hill, rising elegantly from the valley, is an object of extraordinary
interest. Fertility on each side is gradually diminished, and lost in
the superior heights of Blackcomb, in Cumberland, and the high lands
between Kirkby and Ulverstone.</p>

<p>'The road from Broughton to Seathwaite is on the banks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>{103}</span> the Duddon,
and on its Lancashire side it is of various elevations. The river is an
amusing companion, one while brawling and tumbling over rocky
precipices, until the agitated water becomes again calm by arriving at a
smoother and less precipitous bed, but its course is soon again ruffled,
and the current thrown into every variety of form which the rocky
channel of a river can give to water.'&mdash;<i>Vide Green's Guide to the
Lakes</i>, vol. i. pp. 98-100.</p>

<p>After all, the traveller would be most gratified who should approach
this beautiful Stream, neither at its source, as is done in the Sonnets,
nor from its termination; but from Coniston over Walna Scar; first
descending into a little circular valley, a collateral compartment of
the long winding vale through which flows the Duddon. This recess,
towards the close of September, when the after-grass of the meadow is
still of a fresh green, with the leaves of many of the trees faded, but
perhaps none fallen, is truly enchanting. At a point elevated enough to
show the various objects in the valley, and not so high as to diminish
their importance, the stranger will instinctively halt. On the
foreground, a little below the most favourable station, a rude
foot-bridge is thrown over the bed of the noisy brook foaming by the
wayside. Russet and craggy hills, of bold and varied outline, surround
the level valley, which is besprinkled with grey rocks plumed with birch
trees. A few homesteads are interspersed, in some places peeping out
from among the rocks like hermitages, whose site has been chosen for the
benefit of sunshine as well as shelter; in other instances, the
dwelling-house, barn, and byre compose together a cruciform structure,
which, with its embowering trees, and the ivy clothing part of the walls
and roof like a fleece, call to mind the remains of an ancient abbey.
Time, in most cases, and Nature everywhere, have given a sanctity to the
humble works of man that are scattered over this peaceful retirement.
Hence a harmony of tone and colour, a consummation and perfection of
beauty, which would have been marred had aim or purpose interfered with
the course of convenience, utility, or necessity. This unvitiated region
stands in no need of the veil of twilight to soften or disguise its
features. As it glistens in the morning sunshine, it would fill the
spectator's heart with gladsomeness. Looking from our chosen station, he
would feel an impatience<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>{104}</span> to rove among its pathways, to be greeted by
the milkmaid, to wander from house to house, exchanging 'good-morrows'
as he passed the open doors; but, at evening, when the sun is set, and a
pearly light gleams from the western quarter of the sky, with an
answering light from the smooth surface of the meadows; when the trees
are dusky, but each kind still distinguishable; when the cool air has
condensed the blue smoke rising from the cottage chimneys; when the dark
mossy stones seem to sleep in the bed of the foaming brook; <i>then</i>, he
would be unwilling to move forward, not less from a reluctance to
relinquish what he beholds, than from an apprehension of disturbing, by
his approach, the quietness beneath him. Issuing from the plain of this
valley, the brook descends in a rapid torrent passing by the churchyard
of Seathwaite. The traveller is thus conducted at once into the midst of
the wild and beautiful scenery which gave occasion to the Sonnets from
the 14th to the 20th inclusive. From the point where the Seathwaite
brook joins the Duddon, is a view upwards, into the pass through which
the river makes its way into the plain of Donnerdale. The perpendicular
rock on the right bears the ancient British name of THE PEN; the one
opposite is called WALLA-BARROW CRAG, a name that occurs in other places
to designate rocks of the same character. The <i>chaotic</i> aspect of the
scene is well marked by the expression of a stranger, who strolled out
while dinner was preparing, and at his return, being asked by his
host, 'What way he had been wandering?' replied, 'As far as it is
<i>finished</i>!'</p>

<p>The bed of the Duddon is here strewn with large fragments of rocks
fallen from aloft; which, as Mr. Green truly says, 'are happily adapted
to the many-shaped waterfalls,' (or rather water-breaks, for none of
them are high,) 'displayed in the short space of half a mile.' That
there is some hazard in frequenting these desolate places, I myself have
had proof; for one night an immense mass of rock fell upon the very spot
where, with a friend, I had lingered the day before. 'The concussion,'
says Mr. Green, speaking of the event, (for he also, in the practice of
his art, on that day sat exposed for a still longer time to the same
peril,) 'was heard, not without alarm, by the neighbouring shepherds.'
But to return to Seathwaite Churchyard: it contains the following
inscription:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>{105}</span></p>

<h3><a name="poem322" id="poem322" ></a>322. <i>Memoir of the Rev. Robert Walker</i>.</h3>

<div class="center">('Pastor,' in Book vii. of 'The Excursion.')</div>

<p>In the year 1709, Robert Walker was born at Under-crag, in Seathwaite;
he was the youngest of twelve children. His eldest brother, who
inherited the small family estate, died at Under-crag, aged ninety-four,
being twenty-four years older than the subject of this Memoir, who was
born of the same mother. Robert was a sickly infant; and, through his
boyhood and youth, continuing to be of delicate frame and tender health,
it was deemed best, according to the country phrase, to <i>breed him a
scholar</i>; for it was not likely that he would be able to earn a
livelihood by bodily labour. At that period few of these dales were
furnished with schoolhouses; the children being taught to read and write
in the chapel; and in the same consecrated building, where he officiated
for so many years both as preacher and schoolmaster, he himself received
the rudiments of his education. In his youth he became schoolmaster at
Loweswater; not being called upon, probably, in that situation, to teach
more than reading, writing, and arithmetic. But, by the assistance of a
'Gentleman' in the neighbourhood, he acquired, at leisure hours, a
knowledge of the classics, and became qualified for taking holy orders.
Upon his ordination, he had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>{106}</span> offer of two curacies: the one, Torver,
in the vale of Coniston,&mdash;the other, Seathwaite, in his native vale. The
value of each was the same, <i>viz</i>., five pounds <i>per annum</i>: but the
cure of Seathwaite having a cottage attached to it, as he wished to
marry, he chose it in preference. The young person on whom his
affections were fixed, though in the condition of a domestic servant,
had given promise, by her serious and modest deportment, and by her
virtuous dispositions, that she was worthy to become the helpmate of a
man entering upon a plan of life such as he had marked out for himself.
By her frugality she had stored up a small sum of money, with which they
began house-keeping. In 1735 or 1736, he entered upon his curacy; and,
nineteen years afterwards, his situation is thus described, in some
letters to be found in the <i>Annual Register</i> for 1760, from which the
following is extracted:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">'To MR. &mdash;&mdash;.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">'Coniston, July 26, 1754.</span><br />
</p>

<p>'Sir,&mdash;I was the other day upon a party of pleasure, about five or six
miles from this place, where I met with a very striking object, and of a
nature not very common. Going into a clergyman's house (of whom I had
frequently heard), I found him sitting at the head of a long square
table, such as is commonly used in this country by the lower class of
people, dressed in a coarse blue frock, trimmed with black horn buttons;
a checked shirt, a leathern strap about his neck for a stock, a coarse
apron, and a pair of great wooden-soled shoes plated with iron to
preserve them (what we call clogs in these parts), with a child upon his
knee, eating his breakfast; his wife, and the remainder of his children,
were some of them employed in waiting upon each other, the rest in
teasing and spinning wool, at which trade he is a great proficient; and
moreover, when it is made ready for sale, will lay it, by sixteen or
thirty-two pounds' weight, upon his back, and on foot, seven or eight
miles, will carry it to the market, even in the depth of winter. I was
not much surprised at all this, as you may possibly be, having heard a
great deal of it related before. But I must confess myself astonished
with the alacrity and the good humour that appeared both in the
clergyman and his wife, and more so at the sense and ingenuity of the
clergyman himself...'<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>{107}</span></p>

<p>Then follows a letter from another person, dated 1755, from which an
extract shall be given.</p>

<p>'By his frugality and good management, he keeps the wolf from the door,
as we say; and if he advances a little in the world, it is owing more to
his own care, than to anything else he has to rely upon. I don't find
his inclination is running after further preferment. He is settled among
the people, that are happy among themselves; and lives in the greatest
unanimity and friendship with them; and, I believe, the minister and
people are exceedingly satisfied with each other; and indeed how should
they be dissatisfied when they have a person of so much worth and
probity for their pastor? A man who, for his candour and meekness, his
sober, chaste, and virtuous conversation, his soundness in principle and
practice, is an ornament to his profession, and an honour to the country
he is in; and bear with me if I say, the plainness of his dress, the
sanctity of his manners, the simplicity of his doctrine, and the
vehemence of his expression, have a sort of resemblance to the pure
practice of primitive Christianity.'</p>

<p>We will now give his own account of himself, to be found in the same
place.</p>

<div class="center">'FROM THE REV. ROBERT WALKER.</div>

<p>'Sir,&mdash;Yours of the 26th instant was communicated to me by Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;,
and I should have returned an immediate answer, but the hand of
Providence, then laying heavy upon an amiable pledge of conjugal
endearment, hath since taken from me a promising girl, which the
disconsolate mother too pensively laments the loss of; though we have
yet eight living, all healthful, hopeful children, whose names and ages

sixteen years and ten months; Mary, fifteen; Moses, thirteen years and

Esther, one year and three months; besides Anne, who died two years and

died the 23d inst., January, aged six years and ten months. Zaccheus,
the eldest child, is now learning the trade of tanner, and has two years
and a half of his apprenticeship to serve. The annual<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>{108}</span> income of my

being lord of the manor; and 3<i>l.</i> from the several inhabitants of

gardens I value at 4<i>l.</i> yearly, and not worth more; and I believe the
surplice fees and voluntary contributions, one year with another, may be
worth 3<i>l.</i>; but as the inhabitants are few in number, and the fees very
low, this last-mentioned sum consists merely in free-will offerings.</p>

and sound members of the Established Church, not one dissenter of any
denomination being amongst them all. I got to the value of 40<i>l.</i> for my
wife's fortune, but had no real estate of my own, being the youngest son
of twelve children, born of obscure parents; and, though my income has
been but small, and my family large, yet, by a providential blessing
upon my own diligent endeavours, the kindness of friends, and a cheap
country to live in, we have always had the necessaries of life. By what
I have written (which is a true and exact account, to the best of my
knowledge,) I hope you will not think your favour to me, out of the late
worthy Dr. Stratford's effects, quite misbestowed, for which I must ever
gratefully own myself,        Sir,<br />
'Your much obliged and most obedient humble Servant,</p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">'R.W., Curate of S&mdash;&mdash;.</span><br />
<br />
<p>'To Mr. C., of Lancaster.'</p>

<p>About the time when this letter was written the Bishop of Chester
recommended the scheme of joining the curacy of Ulpha to the contiguous
one of Seathwaite, and the nomination was offered to Mr. Walker; but an
unexpected difficulty arising, Mr. W., in a letter to the Bishop, (a
copy of which, in his own beautiful handwriting, now lies before me,)
thus expresses himself. 'If he,' meaning the person in whom the
difficulty originated, 'had suggested any such objection before, I
should utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>{109}</span> have declined any attempt to the curacy of Ulpha;
indeed, I was always apprehensive it might be disagreeable to my
auditory at Seathwaite, as they have been always accustomed to double
duty, and the inhabitants of Ulpha despair of being able to support a
schoolmaster who is not curate there also; which suppressed all thoughts
in me of serving them both.' And in a second letter to the Bishop he
writes:</p>

<p>'My Lord,&mdash;I have the favour of yours of the 1st instant, and am
exceedingly obliged on account of the Ulpha affair: if that curacy
should lapse into your Lordship's hands, I would beg leave rather to
decline than embrace it; for the chapels of Seathwaite and Ulpha,
annexed together, would be apt to cause a general discontent among the
inhabitants of both places; by either thinking themselves slighted,
being only served alternately, or neglected in the duty, or attributing
it to covetousness in me; all which occasions of murmuring I would
willingly avoid.' And in concluding his former letter, he expresses a
similar sentiment upon the same occasion, 'desiring, if it be possible,
however, as much as in me lieth, to live peaceably with all men.'</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The year following, the curacy of Seathwaite was again augmented; and,
to effect this augmentation, fifty pounds had been advanced by himself;
and, in 1760, lands were purchased with eight hundred pounds. Scanty as
was his income, the frequent offer of much better benefices could not
tempt Mr. W. to quit a situation where he had been so long happy, with a
consciousness of being useful. Among his papers I find the following
copy of a letter, dated 1775, twenty years after his refusal of the
curacy of Ulpha, which will show what exertions had been made for one of
his sons.</p>


<p>'May it please your Grace,&mdash;Our remote situation here makes it difficult
to get the necessary information for transacting business regularly;
such is the reason of my giving your Grace the present trouble.</p>

<p>'The bearer (my son) is desirous of offering himself candidate for
deacon's orders at your Grace's ensuing ordination; the first, on the
25th instant, so that his papers could not be transmitted in due time.
As he is now fully at age, and I have afforded him education to the
utmost of my ability, it would give<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>{110}</span> me great satisfaction (if your
Grace would take him, and find him qualified) to have him ordained. His
constitution has been tender for some years; he entered the college of
Dublin, but his health would not permit him to continue there, or I
would have supported him much longer. He has been with me at home above
a year, in which time he has gained great strength of body, sufficient,
I hope, to enable him for performing the function. Divine Providence,
assisted by liberal benefactors, has blest my endeavours, from a small
income, to rear a numerous family; and as my time of life renders me now
unfit for much future expectancy from this world, I should be glad to
see my son settled in a promising way to acquire an honest livelihood
for himself. His behaviour, so far in life, has been irreproachable; and
I hope he will not degenerate, in principles or practice, from the
precepts and pattern of an indulgent parent. Your Grace's favourable
reception of this, from a distant corner of the diocese, and an obscure
hand, will excite filial gratitude, and a due use shall be made of the
obligation vouchsafed thereby to</p>

<p>'Your Grace's very dutiful and most obedient Son and Servant,</p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">ROBERT WALKER.'</span><br />
<br />

<p>The same man, who was thus liberal in the education of his numerous
family, was even munificent in hospitality as a parish priest. Every
Sunday, were served, upon the long table, at which he has been described
sitting with a child upon his knee, messes of broth, for the refreshment
of those of his congregation who came from a distance, and usually took
their seats as parts of his own household. It seems scarcely possible
that this custom could have commenced before the augmentation of his
cure; and what would to many have been a high price of self-denial, was
paid, by the pastor and his family, for this gratification; as the treat
could only be provided by dressing at one time the whole, perhaps, of
their weekly allowance of fresh animal food; consequently, for a
succession of days, the table was covered with cold victuals only. His
generosity in old age may be still further illustrated by a little
circumstance relating to an orphan grandson, then ten years of age,
which I find in a copy of a letter to one of his sons; he requests that
half a guinea may be left for 'little Robert's pocket-money,' who was
then at school: intrusting it to the care of a lady, who, as he says,
'may sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>{111}</span> frustrate his squandering it away foolishly,' and
promising to send him an equal allowance annually for the same purpose.
The conclusion of the same letter is so characteristic, that I cannot
forbear to transcribe it. 'We,' meaning his wife and himself, 'are in
our wonted state of health, allowing for the hasty strides of old age
knocking daily at our door, and threateningly telling us, we are not
only mortal, but must expect ere long to take our leave of our ancient
cottage, and lie down in our last dormitory. Pray pardon my neglect to
answer yours: let us hear sooner from you, to augment the mirth of the
Christmas holidays. Wishing you all the pleasures of the approaching
season, I am, dear Son, with lasting sincerity, yours affectionately,</p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">ROBERT WALKER.'</span><br />
<br />

<p>He loved old customs and old usages, and in some instances stuck to them
to his own loss; for, having had a sum of money lodged in the hands of a
neighbouring tradesman, when long course of time had raised the rate of
interest, and more was offered, he refused to accept it; an act not
difficult to one, who, while he was drawing seventeen pounds a year from
his curacy, declined, as we have seen, to add the profits of another
small benefice to his own, lest he should be suspected of
cupidity.&mdash;From this vice he was utterly free; he made no charge for
teaching school; such as could afford to pay, gave him what they
pleased. When very young, having kept a diary of his expenses, however
trifling, the large amount, at the end of the year, surprised him; and
from that time the rule of his life was to be economical, not
avaricious. At his decease he left behind him no less a sum than
2000<i>l.</i>; and such a sense of his various excellencies was prevalent in
the country, that the epithet of WONDERFUL is to this day attached to
his name.</p>

<p>There is in the above sketch something so extraordinary as to require
further <i>explanatory</i> details.&mdash;And to begin with his industry; eight
hours in each day, during five days in the week, and half of Saturday,
except when the labours of husbandry were urgent, he was occupied in
teaching. His seat was within the rails of the altar; the communion
table was his desk; and, like Shenstone's schoolmistress, the master
employed himself at the spinning-wheel, while the children were
repeating their lessons by his side. Every evening, after school hours,
if not more<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>{112}</span> profitably engaged, he continued the same kind of labour,
exchanging, for the benefit of exercise, the small wheel, at which he
had sate, for the large one on which wool is spun, the spinner stepping
to and fro. Thus, was the wheel constantly in readiness to prevent the
waste of a moment's time. Nor was his industry with the pen, when
occasion called for it, less eager. Intrusted with extensive management
of public and private affairs, he acted, in his rustic neighbourhood, as
scrivener, writing out petitions, deeds of conveyance, wills, covenants,
&amp;c., with pecuniary gain to himself, and to the great benefit of his
employers. These labours (at all times considerable) at one period of
the year, viz., between Christmas and Candlemas, when money transactions
are settled in this country, were often so intense, that he passed great
part of the night, and sometimes whole nights, at his desk. His garden
also was tilled by his own hand; he had a right of pasturage upon the
mountains for a few sheep and a couple of cows, which required his
attendance; with this pastoral occupation, he joined the labours of
husbandry upon a small scale, renting two or three acres in addition to
his own less than one acre of glebe; and the humblest drudgery which the
cultivation of these fields required was performed by himself.</p>

<p>He also assisted his neighbours in haymaking and shearing their flocks,
and in the performance of this latter service he was eminently
dexterous. They, in their turn, complimented him with the present of a
haycock, or a fleece; less as a recompence for this particular service
than as a general acknowledgment. The Sabbath was in a strict sense kept
holy; the Sunday evenings being devoted to reading the Scripture and
family prayer. The principal festivals appointed by the Church were also
duly observed; but through every other day in the week, through every
week in the year, he was incessantly occupied in work of hand or mind;
not allowing a moment for recreation, except upon a Saturday afternoon,
when he indulged himself with a Newspaper, or sometimes with a Magazine.
The frugality and temperance established in his house, were as admirable
as the industry. Nothing to which the name of luxury could be given was
there known; in the latter part of his life, indeed, when tea had been
brought into almost general use, it was provided for visitors, and for
such of his own family as returned occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>{113}</span> to his roof, and had
been accustomed to this refreshment elsewhere; but neither he nor his
wife ever partook of it. The raiment worn by his family was comely and
decent, but as simple as their diet; the home-spun materials were made
up into apparel by their own hands. At the time of the decease of this
thrifty pair, their cottage contained a large store of webs of woollen
and linen cloth, woven from thread of their own spinning. And it is
remarkable that the pew in the chapel in which the family used to sit,
remains neatly lined with woollen cloth spun by the pastor's own hands.
It is the only pew in the chapel so distinguished; and I know of no
other instance of his conformity to the delicate accommodations of
modern times. The fuel of the house, like that of their neighbours,
consisted of peat, procured from the mosses by their own labour. The
lights by which, in the winter evenings, their work was performed, were
of their own manufacture, such as still continue to be used in these
cottages; they are made of the pith of rushes, dipped in any unctuous
substance that the house affords. <i>White</i> candles, as tallow candles are
here called, were reserved to honour the Christmas festivals, and were
perhaps produced upon no other occasions. Once a month, during the
proper season, a sheep was drawn from their small mountain flock, and
killed for the use of the family; and a cow, towards the close of the
year, was salted and dried for winter provision: the hide was tanned to
furnish them with shoes.&mdash;By these various resources, this venerable
clergyman reared a numerous family, not only preserving them, as he
affectingly says, 'from wanting the necessaries of life;' but affording
them an unstinted education, and the means of raising themselves in
society. In this they were eminently assisted by the effects of their
father's example, his precepts, and injunctions: he was aware that
truth-speaking, as a moral virtue, is best secured by inculcating
attention to accuracy of report even on trivial occasions; and so rigid
were the rules of honesty by which he endeavoured to bring up his
family, that if one of them had chanced to find in the lanes or fields
anything of the least use or value without being able to ascertain to
whom it belonged, he always insisted upon the child's carrying it back
to the place from which it had been brought.</p>

<p>No one it might be thought could, as has been described, convert his
body into a machine, as it were, of industry for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>{114}</span> humblest uses, and
keep his thoughts so frequently bent upon secular concerns, without
grievous injury to the more precious parts of his nature. How could the
powers of intellect thrive, or its graces be displayed, in the midst of
circumstances apparently so unfavourable, and where, to the direct
cultivation of the mind, so small a portion of time was allotted? But,
in this extraordinary man, things in their nature adverse were
reconciled. His conversation was remarkable, not only for being chaste
and pure, but for the degree in which it was fervent and eloquent; his
written style was correct, simple, and animated. Nor did his
<i>affections</i> suffer more than his intellect; he was tenderly alive to
all the duties of his pastoral office: the poor and needy 'he never sent
empty away,'&mdash;the stranger was fed and refreshed in passing that
unfrequented vale&mdash;the sick were visited; and the feelings of humanity
found further exercise among the distresses and embarrassments in the
worldly estate of his neighbours, with which his talents for business
made him acquainted; and the disinterestedness, impartiality, and
uprightness which he maintained in the management of all affairs
confided to him, were virtues seldom separated in his own conscience
from religious obligation. Nor could such conduct fail to remind those
who witnessed it of a spirit nobler than law or custom: they felt
convictions which, but for such intercourse, could not have been
afforded, that, as in the practice of their pastor, there was no guile,
so in his faith there was nothing hollow; and we are warranted in
believing, that upon these occasions, selfishness, obstinacy, and
discord would often give way before the breathings of his good-will, and
saintly integrity. It may be presumed also&mdash;while his humble
congregation were listening to the moral precepts which he delivered
from the pulpit, and to the Christian exhortations that they should love
their neighbours as themselves, and do as they would be done unto&mdash;that
peculiar efficacy was given to the preacher's labours by recollections
in the minds of his congregation, that they were called upon to do no
more than his own actions were daily setting before their eyes.</p>

<p>The afternoon service in the chapel was less numerously attended than
that of the morning, but by a more serious auditory; the lesson from the
New Testament, on those occasions, was accompanied by Burkitt's
Commentaries. These lessons he read with impassioned emphasis,
frequently drawing tears from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>{115}</span> hearers, and leaving a lasting
impression upon their minds. His devotional feelings and the powers of
his own mind were further exercised, along with those of his family, in
perusing the Scriptures; not only on the Sunday evenings, but on every
other evening, while the rest of the household were at work, some one of
the children, and in her turn the servant, for the sake of practice in
reading, or for instruction, read the Bible aloud; and in this manner
the whole was repeatedly gone through. That no common importance was
attached to the observance of religious ordinances by his family,
appears from the following memorandum by one of his descendants, which I
am tempted to insert at length, as it is characteristic, and somewhat
curious. 'There is a small chapel in the county palatine of Lancaster,
where a certain clergyman has regularly officiated above sixty years,
and a few months ago administered the sacrament of the Lord's Supper in
the same, to a decent number of devout communicants. After the clergyman
had received himself, the first company out of the assembly who
approached the altar, and kneeled down to be partakers of the sacred
elements, consisted of the parson's wife; to whom he had been married
upwards of sixty years; one son and his wife; four daughters, each with
her husband; whose ages, all added together, amount to above 714 years.
The several and respective distances from the place of each of their
abodes, to the chapel where they all communicated, will measure more
than 1000 English miles. Though the narration will appear surprising, it
is without doubt a fact that the same persons, exactly four years
before, met at the same place, and all joined in performance of the same
venerable duty.'</p>

<p>He was indeed most zealously attached to the doctrine and frame of the
Established Church. We have seen him congratulating himself that he had
no dissenters in his cure of any denomination. Some allowance must be
made for the state of opinion when his first religious impressions were
received, before the reader will acquit him of bigotry, when I mention,
that at the time of the augmentation of the cure, he refused to invest
part of the money in the purchase of an estate offered to him upon
advantageous terms, because the proprietor was a Quaker;&mdash;whether from
scrupulous apprehension that a blessing would not attend a contract
framed for the benefit of the Church <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>{116}</span>between persons not in religious
sympathy with each other; or, as a seeker of peace, he was afraid of the
uncomplying disposition which at one time was too frequently conspicuous
in that sect. Of this an instance had fallen under his own notice; for,
while he taught school at Loweswater, certain persons of that
denomination had refused to pay annual interest due under the title of
Church-stock;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a great hardship upon the incumbent, for the curacy of
Loweswater was then scarcely less poor than that of Seathwaite. To what
degree this prejudice of his was blameable need not be
determined;&mdash;certain it is, that he was not only desirous, as he himself
says, to live in peace, but in love, with all men. He was placable, and
charitable in his judgments; and, however correct in conduct and
rigorous to himself, he was ever ready to forgive the trespasses of
others, and to soften the censure that was cast upon their
frailties.&mdash;It would be unpardonable to omit that, in the maintenance of
his virtues, he received due support from the partner of his long life.
She was equally strict, in attending to her share of their joint cares,
nor less diligent in her appropriate occupations. A person who had been
some time their servant in the latter part of their lives, concluded the
panegyric of her mistress by saying to me, 'She was no less excellent
than her husband; she was good to the poor; she was good to every
thing!' He survived for a short time this virtuous companion. When she
died, he ordered that her body should be borne to the grave by three of
her daughters and one grand-daughter; and, when the corpse was lifted
from the threshold, he insisted upon lending his aid, and feeling about,
for he was then almost blind, took hold of a napkin fixed to the coffin;
and, as a bearer of the body, entered the chapel, a few steps from the
lowly parsonage.</p>

<p>What a contrast does the life of this obscurely-seated, and, in point of
worldly wealth, poorly-repaid Churchman, present to that of a Cardinal
Wolsey!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>We have been dwelling upon images of peace in the moral world, that have
brought us again to the quiet enclosure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>{117}</span> consecrated ground, in which
this venerable pair lie interred. The sounding brook, that rolls close
by the churchyard, without disturbing feeling or meditation, is now
unfortunately laid bare; but not long ago it participated, with the
chapel, the shade of some stately ash-trees, which will not spring
again. While the spectator from this spot is looking round upon the
girdle of stony mountains that encompasses the vale,&mdash;masses of rock,
out of which monuments for all men that ever existed might have been
hewn&mdash;it would surprise him to be told, as with truth he might be, that
the plain blue slab dedicated to the memory of this aged pair is a
production of a quarry in North Wales. It was sent as a mark of respect
by one of their descendants from the vale of Festiniog, a region almost
as beautiful as that in which it now lies!</p>

<p>Upon the Seathwaite Brook, at a small distance from the parsonage, has
been erected a mill for spinning yarn; it is a mean and disagreeable
object, though not unimportant to the spectator, as calling to mind the
momentous changes wrought by such inventions in the frame of
society&mdash;changes which have proved especially unfavourable to these
mountain solitudes. So much had been effected by those new powers,
before the subject of the preceding biographical sketch closed his life,
that their operation could not escape his notice, and doubtless excited
touching reflections upon the comparatively insignificant results of his
own manual industry. But Robert Walker was not a man of times and
circumstances; had he lived at a later period, the principle of duty
would have produced application as unremitting; the same energy of
character would have been displayed, though in many instances with
widely different effects.</p>

<p>With pleasure I annex, as illustrative and confirmatory of the above
account, extracts from a paper in the <i>Christian Remembrancer</i>, October,
1819: it bears an assumed signature, but is known to be the work of the
Rev. Bobert Bamford, vicar of Bishopton, in the county of Durham; a
great-grandson of Mr. Walker, whose worth it commemorates, by a record
not the less valuable for being written in very early youth.</p>

<p>'His house was a nursery of virtue. All the inmates were industrious,
and cleanly, and happy. Sobriety, neatness, quietness, characterised the
whole family. No railings, no idleness, no indulgence of passion, were
permitted. Every child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>{118}</span> ever young, had its appointed engagements;
every hand was busy. Knitting, spinning, reading, writing, mending
clothes, making shoes, were by the different children constantly
performing. The father himself sitting amongst them, and guiding their
thoughts, was engaged in the same occupations....</p>

<p>'He sate up late, and rose early; when the family were at rest, he
retired to a little room which he had built on the roof of his house. He
had slated it, and fitted it up with shelves for his books, his stock of
cloth, wearing apparel, and his utensils. There many a cold winter's
night, without fire, while the roof was glazed with ice, did he remain
reading or writing till the day dawned. He taught the children in the
chapel, for there was no schoolhouse. Yet in that cold, damp place he
never had a fire. He used to send the children in parties either to his
own fire at home, or make them run up the mountain side.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>'It may be further mentioned, that he was a passionate admirer of
Nature; she was his mother, and he was a dutiful child. While engaged on
the mountains it was his greatest pleasure to view the rising sun; and
in tranquil evenings, as it slided behind the hills, he blessed its
departure. He was skilled in fossils and plants; a constant observer of
the stars and winds: the atmosphere was his delight. He made many
experiments on its nature and properties. In summer he used to gather a
multitude of flies and insects, and, by his entertaining description,
amuse and instruct his children. They shared all his daily employments,
and derived many sentiments of love and benevolence from his
observations on the works and productions of Nature. Whether they were
following him in the field, or surrounding him in school, he took every
opportunity of storing their minds with useful information.&mdash;Nor was the
circle of his influence confined to Seathwaite. Many a distant mother
has told her child of Mr. Walker, and begged him to be as good a man.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>'Once, when I was very young, I had the pleasure of seeing and hearing
that venerable old man in his 90th year, and even then, the calmness,
the force, the perspicuity of his sermon, sanctified and adorned by the
wisdom of grey hairs, and the authority of virtue, had such an effect
upon my mind, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>{119}</span> I never see a hoary-headed clergyman, without
thinking of Mr. Walker.... He allowed no dissenter or methodist to
interfere in the instruction of the souls committed to his cure: and so
successful were his exertions, that he had not one dissenter of any
denomination whatever in the whole parish.&mdash;Though he avoided all
religious controversies, yet when age had silvered his head, and
virtuous piety had secured to his appearance reverence and silent
honour, no one, however determined in his hatred of apostolic descent,
could have listened to his discourse on ecclesiastical history and
ancient times, without thinking, that one of the beloved apostles had
returned to mortality, and in that vale of peace had come to exemplify
the beauty of holiness in the life and character of Mr. Walker.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>'Until the sickness of his wife, a few months previous to her death, his
health and spirits and faculties were unimpaired. But this misfortune
gave him such a shock, that his constitution gradually decayed. His
senses, except sight, still preserved their powers. He never preached
with steadiness after his wife's death. His voice faltered: he always
looked at the seat she had used. He could not pass her tomb without
tears. He became, when alone, sad and melancholy, though still among his
friends kind and good-humoured. He went to bed about twelve o'clock the
night before his death. As his custom was, he went, tottering and
leaning upon his daughter's arm, to examine the heavens, and meditate a
few moments in the open air. "How clear the moon shines to-night!" He
said these words, sighed, and laid down. At six next morning he was
found a corpse. Many a tear, and many a heavy heart, and many a grateful
blessing followed him to the grave.'</p>

<p>Having mentioned in this narrative the vale of Loweswater as a place
where Mr. Walker taught school, I will add a few memoranda from its
parish register, respecting a person apparently of desires as moderate,
with whom he must have been intimate during his residence there.</p>

<h3><a name="poem324" id="poem324" ></a>324. <i>The White Doe of Rylstone; or the Fate of the Nortons</i>.</h3>

<div class="center">ADVERTISEMENT.</div>

<p>During the summer of 1807 I visited, for the first time, the beautiful
country that surrounds Bolton Priory, in Yorkshire; and the Poem of the
White Doe, founded upon a tradition connected with that place, was
composed at the close of the same year.</p>

<div class="center">THE WHITE DOE OF RYLSTONE.</div>

<p>The Poem of the White Doe of Rylstone is founded on a local tradition,
and on the Ballad in Percy's Collection, entitled, 'The Rising of the
North.' The tradition is as follows: 'About this time,' not long after
the Dissolution, 'a White Doe,' say the aged people of the
neighbourhood, 'long continued to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>{121}</span> a weekly pilgrimage from
Rylstone over the falls of Bolton, and was constantly found in the Abbey
Churchyard during divine service; after the close of which she returned
home as regularly as the rest of the congregation.'&mdash;Dr. Whitaker's
<i>History of the Deanery of Craven</i>.&mdash;Rylstone was the property and
residence of the Nortons, distinguished in that ill-advised and
unfortunate Insurrection; which led me to connect with this tradition
the principal circumstances of their fate, as recorded in the Ballad.</p>

<p>'Bolton Priory,' says Dr. Whitaker in his excellent book, <i>The History
and Antiquities of the Deanery of Craven</i>, 'stands upon a beautiful
curvature of the Wharf, on a level sufficiently elevated to protect it
from inundations, and low enough for every purpose of picturesque
effect.</p>

<p>'Opposite to the east window of the Priory Church the river washes the
foot of a rock nearly perpendicular, and of the richest purple, where
several of the mineral beds, which break out, instead of maintaining
their usual inclination to the horizon, are twisted by some
inconceivable process into undulating and spiral lines. To the south all
is soft and delicious; the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures, a
moderate reach of the river, sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to
the sun, and the bounding hills beyond, neither too near nor too lofty
to exclude, even in winter, any portion of his rays.</p>

<p>'But, after all, the glories of Bolton are on the north. Whatever the
most fastidious taste could require to constitute a perfect landscape,
is not only found here, but in its proper place. In front, and
immediately under the eye, is a smooth expanse of park-like enclosure,
spotted with native elm, ash, &amp;c. of the finest growth: on the right a
skirting oak wood, with jutting points of grey rock; on the left a
rising copse. Still forward are seen the aged groves of Bolton Park, the
growth of centuries; and farther yet, the barren and rocky distances of
Simonseat and Barden Fell contrasted with the warmth, fertility, and
luxuriant foliage of the valley below.</p>

<p>'About half a mile above Bolton the valley closes, and either side of
the Wharf is overhung by solemn woods, from which huge perpendicular
masses of grey rock jut out at intervals.</p>

<p>'This sequestered scene was almost inaccessible till of late, that
ridings have been cut on both sides of the river, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>{122}</span> most
interesting points laid open by judicious thinnings in the woods. Here a
tributary stream rushes from a waterfall, and bursts through a woody
glen to mingle its waters with the Wharf: there the Wharf itself is
nearly lost in a deep cleft in the rock, and next becomes a horned flood
enclosing a woody island&mdash;sometimes it reposes for a moment, and then
resumes its native character, lively, irregular, and impetuous.</p>

<p>'The cleft mentioned above is the tremendous STRID. This chasm, being
incapable of receiving the winter floods, has formed on either side a
broad strand of naked gritstone full of rock-basins, or "pots of the
Linn," which bear witness to the restless impetuosity of so many
Northern torrents. But, if here Wharf is lost to the eye, it amply
repays another sense by its deep and solemn roar, like "the Voice of the
angry Spirit of the Waters," heard far above and beneath, amidst the
silence of the surrounding woods.</p>

<p>'The terminating object of the landscape is the remains of Barden Tower,
interesting from their form and situation, and still more so from the
recollections which they excite.'</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem325" id="poem325" ></a>325. *<i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i>.</h3>

<p>The earlier half of this poem was composed at Stockton-upon-Tees, when
Mary and I were on a visit to her eldest brother, Mr. Hutchinson, at the
close of the year 1807. The country is flat, and the weather was rough.
I was accustomed every day to walk to and fro under the shelter of a row
of stacks, in a field at a small distance from the town, and there
poured forth my verses aloud, as freely as they would come. Mary reminds
me that her brother stood upon the punctilio of not sitting down to
dinner till I joined the party; and it frequently happened that I did
not make my appearance till too late, so that she was made
uncomfortable. I here beg her pardon for this and similar transgressions
during the whole course of our wedded life. To my beloved sister the
same apology is due.</p>

<p>When, from the visit just mentioned, we returned to Town-End, Grasmere,
I proceeded with the poem. It may be worth while to note as a caution to
others who may cast their eyes on these memoranda, that the skin having
been rubbed off my heel by my wearing too tight a shoe, though I
desisted from walking, I found that the irritation of the wounded part
was kept up<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>{123}</span> by the act of composition, to a degree that made it
necessary to give my constitution a holiday. A rapid cure was the
consequence.</p>

<p>Poetic excitement, when accompanied by protracted labour in composition,
has throughout my life brought on more or less bodily derangement.
Nevertheless I am, at the close of my seventy-third year, in what may be
called excellent health. So that intellectual labour is not,
necessarily, unfavourable to longevity. But perhaps I ought here to add,
that mine has been generally carried on out of doors.</p>

<p>Let me here say a few words of this Poem, by way of criticism. The
subject being taken from feudal times has led to its being compared to
some of Walter Scott's poems that belong to the same age and state of
society. The comparison is inconsiderate. Sir Walter pursued the
customary and very natural course of conducting an action, presenting
various turns of fortune, to some outstanding point on which the mind
might rest as a termination or catastrophe. The course I attempted to
pursue is entirely different. Everything that is attempted by the
principal personages in the 'White Doe' fails, so far as its object is
external and substantial: so far as it is moral and spiritual, it
succeeds. The heroine of the poem knows that her duty is not to
interfere with the current of events, either to forward or delay them;
but&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">'To abide<br /></span>
<span>The shock, and finally secure<br /></span>
<span>O'er pain and grief a triumph pure.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This she does in obedience to her brother's injunction, as most suitable
to a mind and character that, under previous trials, had been proved to
accord with his. She achieves this, not without aid from the
communication with the inferior creature, which often leads her thoughts
to revolve upon the past with a tender and humanising influence that
exalts rather than depresses her. The anticipated beatification, if I
may so say, of her mind, and the apotheosis of the companion of her
solitude, are the points at which the poem aims, and constitute its
legitimate catastrophe; far too spiritual a one for instant or
widely-spread sympathy, but not therefore the less fitted to make a deep
and permanent impression upon that class of minds who think and feel
more independently than the many do of the surfaces of things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>{124}</span> and
interests transitory because belonging more to the outward and social
forms of life than to its internal spirit.</p>

<p>How insignificant a thing, for example, does personal prowess appear,
compared with the fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom; in other
words, with struggles for the sake of principle, in preference to
victory gloried in for its own sake!</p>

<p>[To these remarks may be added the following, in a letter from the
writer to his friend Archdeacon Wrangham:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">'Thanksgiving Day, Jan. 1816.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">Rydal Mount.</span><br />
</p>

<p>'MY DEAR WRANGHAM,</p>

<p>'You have given me an additional mark of that friendly disposition, and
those affectionate feelings which I have long known you to possess, by
writing to me after my long and unjustifiable silence.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>'Of the "White Doe" I have little to say, but that I hope it will be
acceptable to the intelligent, for whom alone it is written. It starts
from a high point of imagination, and comes round, through various
wanderings of that faculty, to a still higher&mdash;nothing less than the
apotheosis of the animal who gives the first of the two titles to the
poem. And as the poem thus begins and ends with pure and lofty
imagination, every motive and impetus that actuates the persons
introduced is from the same source; a kindred spirit pervades, and is
intended to harmonise the whole. Throughout, objects (the banner, for
instance) derive their influence, not from properties inherent in them,
not from what they <i>are</i> actually in themselves, but from such as are
<i>bestowed</i> upon them by the minds of those who are conversant with or
affected by those objects. Thus the poetry, if there be any in the work,
proceeds, as it ought to do, from the <i>soul of man</i>, communicating its
creative energies to the images of the external world. But, too much of
this.</p>

<br />
<h3><a name="poem332" id="poem332" ></a>332. <i>Ecclesiastical Sonnets in Series</i>.</h3>

<p>ADVERTISEMENT.</p>

<p>During the month of December, 1820, I accompanied a much-beloved and
honoured Friend in a walk through different parts of his estate, with a
view to fix upon the site of a new Church which he intended to erect. It
was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season,&mdash;our feelings
were in harmony with the cherishing influences of the scene; and such
being our purpose, we were naturally led to look back upon past events
with wonder and gratitude, and on the future with hope. Not long
afterwards, some of the Sonnets which will be found towards the close of
this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning's
occupation.</p>

<p>The Catholic Question, which was agitated in Parliament about that time,
kept my thoughts in the same course; and it struck me that certain
points in the Ecclesiastical History of our Country might advantageously
be presented to view in verse. Accordingly, I took up the subject, and
what I now offer to the reader was the result.</p>

<p>When this work was far advanced, I was agreeably surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>{127}</span> to find that
my friend, Mr. Southey, had been engaged with similar views in writing a
concise History of the Church <i>in</i> England. If our Productions, thus
unintentionally coinciding, shall be found to illustrate each other, it
will prove a high gratification to me, which I am sure my friend will
participate.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">W. WORDSWORTH.</span><br />
Rydal Mount, January 24, 1822.<br />
</p>

<p>For the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another
without shocks of abruptness, this work has taken the shape of a series
of Sonnets: but the Reader, it is to be hoped, will find that the
pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of
passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection
but one that bears upon the Poet only&mdash;its difficulty.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem333" id="poem333" ></a>333. *<i>Introductory Remarks</i>.</h3>

<p>My purpose in writing this Series was, as much as possible, to confine
my view to the 'introduction, progress, and operation of the CHURCH in
ENGLAND, both previous and subsequent to the Reformation. The Sonnets
were written long before Ecclesiastical History and points of doctrine
had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired
into and discussed. The former particular is mentioned as an excuse for
my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been
selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the Popedom
over temporal sovereignty had attained, and the arrogance with which it
was displayed. I allude to the last sonnet but one in the first series,
where Pope Alexander the Third, at Venice, is described as setting his
foot on the neck of the Emperor Barbarossa. Though this is related as a
fact in history, I am told it is a mere legend of no authority.
Substitute for it an undeniable truth, not less fitted for my purpose,
namely, the penance inflicted by Gregory the Seventh upon the Emperor
Henry the Fourth, at [Canosa].<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Before I conclude my notice of these Sonnets, let me observe that the
opinion I pronounced in favour of Laud (long before the Oxford Tract
movement), and which had brought censure upon me from several quarters,
is not in the least changed. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>{128}</span>Omitting here to examine into his conduct
in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged, I
am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had
been abandoned, were good and wise, whatever errors he might commit in
the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them. I further believe,
that had not he, and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did,
stood up in opposition to the Reformers of that period, it is
questionable whether the Church would ever have recovered its lost
ground, and become the blessing it now is, and will, I trust, become in
a still greater degree, both to those of its communion, and those who
unfortunately are separated from it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'<i> 1 saw the Figure of a lovely Maid</i>.' [Sonnet I. Part III.]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When I came to this part of the Series I had the dream described in this
sonnet. The figure was that of my daughter, and the whole past exactly
as here represented. The sonnet was composed on the middle road leading
from Grasmere to Ambleside: it was begun as I left the last house in the
vale, and finished, word for word, as it now stands, before I came in
view of Rydal. I wish I could say the same of the five or six hundred I
have written: most of them were frequently retouched in the course of
composition, and not a few laboriously.</p>

<p>I have only further to observe that the intended church which prompted
these Sonnets was erected on Coleorton Moor, towards the centre of a
very populous parish, between three and four miles from
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, on the road to Loughborough, and has proved, I
believe, a great benefit to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>[POSTSCRIPT.</p>

<p>As an addition to these general remarks on the 'Ecclesiastical Sonnets,'
it seems only right to give here from the <i>Memoirs</i> (vol. ii. p. 113)
the following on Sonnet XL. (Pt. II.):</p>

<p>The invidious inferences that would be drawn from this epithet by the
enemies of the English Church and Reformation are too obvious to be
dilated on. The author was aware of this, and in reply to a friend who
called his attention to the misconstruction and perversion to which the
passage was liable, he replied as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>{129}</span></p>

MY DEAR C&mdash;&mdash;,<br />
</p>

<p>'The passage which you have been so kind as to comment upon in one of
the "Ecclesiastical Sonnets," was altered several years ago by my pen,
in a copy of my poems which I possess, but the correction was not
printed till a place was given it in the last edition, printed last
year, in one volume. It there stands,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Their church reformed."</p></div>

<p>Though for my own part, as I mentioned some time since in a letter I had
occasion to write to the Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;, I do not like the term
<i>reformed</i>; if taken in its literal sense, as a <i>transformation</i>, it is
very objectionable.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Further, on the Sonnets on 'Aspects of Christianity in America,'
Wordsworth wrote to his valued friend, Professor Reed of Philadelphia,
as follows:</p>

<p>'A few days ago, after a very long interval, I returned to poetical
composition; and my first employment was to write a couple of sonnets
upon subjects recommended by you to take place in the Ecclesiastical
Series. They are upon the Marriage Ceremony and the Funeral Service. I
have also, at the same time, added two others, one upon Visiting the
Sick, and the other upon the Thanksgiving of Women after Childbirth,
both subjects taken from the Services of our Liturgy. To the second part
of the same series, I have also added two, in order to do more justice
to the Papal Church for the services which she did actually render to
Christianity and humanity in the Middle Ages. By the by, the sonnet
beginning, "Men of the Western World," &amp;c. was slightly altered after I
sent it to you, not in the hope of substituting a better verse, but
merely to avoid the repetition of the same word, "book," which occurs as
a rhyme in "The Pilgrim Fathers." These three sonnets, I learn, from
several quarters, have been well received by those of your countrymen
whom they most concern.']<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Stillingfleet adduces many arguments in support of this opinion, but
they are unconvincing. The latter part of this Sonnet (II.
'Conjectures') refers to a favourite notion of Roman Catholic writers,
that Joseph of Arimathea and his companions brought Christianity into
Britain, and built a rude church at Glastonbury; alluded to hereafter in

delicate feeling delightful to meet with in that rude age, traces of
which are frequent in his works:&mdash;'Variis herbarum floribus depictus imo

<p>The last six lines of this Sonnet are chiefly from the prose of Daniel;
and here I will state (though to the Readers whom this Poem will chiefly
interest it is unnecessary) that my obligations to other prose writers
are frequent,&mdash;obligations which, even if I had not a pleasure in
courting, it would have been presumptuous to shun, in treating an
historical subject. I must, however, particularise Fuller, to whom I am
indebted in the Sonnet upon Wycliffe and in other instances. And upon
the acquittal of the Seven Bishops I have done little more than versify
a lively description of that event in the MS. Memoirs of the first Lord
Lonsdale.</p>

Taliesen was present at the battle which preceded this desolation. The
account Bede gives of this remarkable event, suggests a most striking
warning against National and Religious prejudices.</p>

<p>The person of Paulinus is thus described by Bede, from the memory of an

<p>'Man's life is like a sparrow.' [Sonnet XVI. l. 1.]</p>

<p>See the original of this speech in Bede.&mdash;The Conversion of Edwin, as
related by him, is highly interesting&mdash;and the breaking up of this
Council accompanied with an event so striking and characteristic, that I
am tempted to give it at length in a translation. 'Who, exclaimed the
King, when the Council was ended, shall first desecrate the altars and
the temples? I, answered the Chief Priest; for who more fit than myself,
through<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>{132}</span> the wisdom which the true God hath given me, to destroy, for
the good example of others, what in foolishness is worshipped?
Immediately, casting away vain superstition, he besought the King to
grant him what the laws did not allow to a priest, arms and a courser
(equum emissarium); which mounting, and furnished with a sword and
lance, he proceeded to destroy the Idols. The crowd, seeing this,
thought him mad&mdash;he however halted not, but, approaching the profaned
temple, casting against it the lance which he had held in his hand, and,
exulting in acknowledgment of the worship of the true God, he ordered
his companions to pull down the temple, with all its enclosures. The
place is shown where those idols formerly stood, not far from York, at
the source of the river Derwent, and is at this day called Gormund Gaham
ubi pontifex ille, inspirante Deo vero, polluit ac destruxit eas, <i>quas
ipse sacraverat aras</i>.' The last expression is a pleasing proof that the
venerable monk of Wearmouth was familiar with the poetry of Virgil.</p>

his speech before the bar of the House of Peers:&mdash;'Ever since I came in

worship of God, so much slighted in divers parts of this kingdom, might
be preserved, and that with as much decency and uniformity as might be.
For I evidently saw that the publick neglect of God's service in the
outward face of it, and the nasty lying of many places dedicated to that
service, <i>had almost cast a damp upon the true and inward worship of
God, which while we live in the body, needs external helps, and all

long life was closed, twenty-six bishops had been consecrated in
America, by himself. For his character and opinions, see his own

<p>Among the benefits arising, as Mr. Coleridge has well observed, from a
Church Establishment of endowments corresponding with the wealth of the
country to which it belongs, may be reckoned as eminently important, the
examples of civility and refinement which the Clergy stationed at
intervals, afford to the whole people. The Established clergy in many
parts of England have long been, as they continue to be, the principal
bulwark against barbarism, and the link which unites the sequestered
peasantry with the intellectual advancement of the age. Nor is it below
the dignity of the subject to observe, that their taste, as acting upon
rural residences and scenery often furnishes models which country
gentlemen, who are more at liberty to follow the caprices of fashion,
might profit by. The precincts of an old residence must be treated by
ecclesiastics with respect, both from prudence and necessity. I remember
being much pleased, some years ago, at Rose Castle, the rural seat of
the See of Carlisle, with a style of garden and architecture, which, if
the place had belonged to a wealthy layman, would no doubt have been
swept away. A parsonage-house generally stands not far from the church;
this proximity imposes favourable restraints, and sometimes suggests an
affecting union of the accommodations and elegances of life with the
outward signs of piety and mortality. With pleasure I recall to mind a
happy instance of this in the residence of an old and much-valued Friend
in Oxfordshire. The house and church stand parallel to each other, at a
small distance; a circular lawn or rather grass-plot, spreads between
them; shrubs and trees curve from each side of the dwelling, veiling,
but not hiding, the church. From the front of this dwelling, no part of
the burial-ground is seen; but as you wind by the side of the shrubs
towards the steeple-end of the church, the eye catches a single, small,
low, monumental headstone, moss-grown, sinking into, and gently
inclining towards the earth. Advance, and the churchyard, populous and
gay with glittering tombstones, opens upon the view. This humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>{137}</span> and
beautiful parsonage called forth a tribute, for which see the seventh of

<p>The following stanzas ['Yarrow Revisited'] are a memorial of a day
passed with Sir Walter Scott, and other friends, visiting the banks of
the Yarrow under his guidance, immediately before his departure from

<h3><a name="poem363" id="poem363" ></a>363. *<i>Yarrow Revisited</i>.</h3>

<p>I first became acquainted with this great and amiable man (Sir Walter
Scott) in the year 1803, when my sister and I, making a tour in
Scotland, were hospitably received by him in Lasswade, upon the banks of
the Esk, where he was then living. We saw a good deal of him in the
course of the following week. The particulars are given in my sister's
journal of that tour.</p>


<p>(2) *<i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p>In the autumn of 1831, my daughter and I set off from Rydal to visit Sir
Walter Scott, before his departure for Italy. This journey had been
delayed, by an inflammation in my eyes, till we found that the time
appointed for his leaving home would be too near for him to receive us
without considerable inconvenience. Nevertheless, we proceeded, and
reached Abbotsford on Monday. I was then scarcely able to lift up my
eyes to the light. How sadly changed did I find him from the man I had
seen so healthy, gay, and hopeful a few years before, when he said at
the inn at Paterdale, in my presence, his daughter Anne also being
there, with Mr. Lockhart, my own wife and daughter, and Mr. Quillinan,
'I mean to live till I am eighty, and shall write as long as I live.'
Though we had none of us the least thought of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>{139}</span> cloud of misfortune
which was then going to break upon his head, I was startled, and almost
shocked, at that bold saying, which could scarcely be uttered by such a
man, sanguine as he was, without a momentary forgetfulness of the
instability of human life. But to return to Abbotsford. The inmates and
guests we found there were Sir Walter, Major Scott, Anne Scott, and Mr.
and Mrs. Lockhart; Mr. Liddell, his lady and brother, and Mr. Allan, the
painter, and Mr. Laidlaw, a very old friend of Sir Walter's. One of
Burns's sons, an officer in the Indian service, had left the house a day
or two before, and had kindly expressed his regret that he could not
wait my arrival, a regret that I may truly say was mutual. In the
evening, Mr. and Mrs. Liddell sang, and Mrs. Lockhart chaunted old
ballads to her harp; and Mr. Allan, hanging over the back of a chair,
told and acted odd stories in a humorous way. With this exhibition, and
his daughter's singing, Sir Walter was much amused, and, indeed, were we
all, as far as circumstances would allow. But what is most worthy of
mention is the admirable demeanour of Major Scott during that
evening.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He had much to suffer from the sight of his father's
infirmities and from the great change that was about to take place at
the residence he had built, and where he had long lived in so much
prosperity and happiness. But what struck me most was the patient
kindness with which he supported himself under the many fretful
expressions that his sister Anne addressed to him or uttered in his
hearing, and she, poor thing, as mistress of that house, had been
subject, after her mother's death, to a heavier load of care and
responsibility, and greater sacrifices of time, than one of such a
constitution of body and mind was able to bear. Of this Dora and I were
made so sensible, that as soon as we had crossed the Tweed on our
departure, we gave vent at the same moment to our apprehensions that her
brain would fail and she would go out of her mind, or that she would
sink under the trials she had passed and those which awaited her.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, Sir Walter Scott accompanied us, and most of the
party, to Newark Castle, on the <i>Yarrow</i>. When we alighted from the
carriages, he walked pretty stoutly, and had great pleasure in
revisiting these his favourite haunts. Of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>{140}</span> excursion, the verses,
'Yarrow Revisited' are a memorial. Notwithstanding the romance that
pervades Sir Walter's works, and attaches to many of his habits, there
is too much pressure of fact for these verses to harmonise, as much as I
could wish, with the two preceding poems. On our return in the
afternoon, we had to cross the Tweed, directly opposite Abbotsford. The
wheels of our carriage grated upon the pebbles in the bed of the stream,
that there flows somewhat rapidly. A rich, but sad light, of rather a
purple than a golden hue, was spread over the Eildon Hills at that
moment; and, thinking it probable that it might be the last time Sir
Walter would cross the stream, I was not a little moved, and expressed
some of my feelings in the sonnet beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'A trouble, not of clouds,' &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At noon on Thursday we left Abbotsford, and on the morning of that day,
Sir Walter and I had a serious conversation, <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, when he
spoke with gratitude of the happy life which, upon the whole, he had
led. He had written in my daughter's album, before he came into the
breakfast-room that morning, a few stanzas addressed to her; and while
putting the book into her hand, in his own Study, standing by his desk,
he said to her in my presence, 'I should not have done any thing of this
kind, but for your father's sake; they are probably the last verses I
shall ever write.' They show how much his mind was impaired; not by the
strain of thought, but by the execution, some of the lines being
imperfect, and one stanza wanting corresponding rhymes. One letter, the
initial S., had been omitted in the spelling of his own name. In this
interview, also, it was that, upon my expressing a hope of his health
being benefited by the climate of the country to which he was going, and
by the interest he would take in the classic remembrances of Italy, he
made use of the quotation from 'Yarrow Revisited,' as recorded by me in
the 'Musings at Aquapendente,' six years afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. Lockhart has mentioned in his life of him, what I heard from several
quarters while abroad, both at Rome and elsewhere, that little seemed to
interest him but what he could collect or heard of the fugitive Stuarts,
and their adherents who had followed them into exile. Both the 'Yarrow
Revisited' and the 'Sonnet' were sent him before his departure from
England. Some further particulars of the conversations which occurred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>{141}</span>during this visit I should have set down, had they not been already
accurately recorded by Mr. Lockhart.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem364" id="poem364" ></a>364. *<i>A Place of Burial in the South of Scotland</i>. [III.]</h3>

<p>Similar places for burial are not unfrequent in Scotland. The one that
suggested this sonnet lies on the banks of a small stream, called the
Wauchope, that flows into the Esk near Langholme. Mickle, who, as it
appears from his poem on Sir Martin, was not without genuine poetic
feelings, was born and passed his boyhood in this neighbourhood, under
his father, who was a minister of the Scotch Kirk. The Esk, both above
and below Langholme, flows through a beautiful country; and the two
streams of the Wauchope and the Ewes, which join it near that place, are
such as a pastoral poet would delight in.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem365" id="poem365" ></a>365. *<i>On the Sight of a Manse in the South of Scotland</i>. [IV.]</h3>

<p>The manses in Scotland, and the gardens and grounds about them, have
seldom that attractive appearance which is common about our English
parsonages, even when the clergyman's income falls below the average of
the Scotch minister's. This is not merely owing to the one country being
poor in comparison with the other, but arises rather out of the equality
of their benefices, so that no one has enough to spare for decorations
that might serve as an example for others, whereas with us the taste of
the richer incumbent extends its influence more or less to the poorest.</p>

<p>After all, in these observations, the surface only of the matter is
touched. I once heard a conversation, in which the Roman Catholic
religion was decried on account of its abuses: 'You cannot deny,
however,' said a lady of the party, repeating an expression used by
Charles II., 'that it is the religion of a gentleman.' It may be left to
the Scotch themselves to determine how far this observation applies to
the [religion] of their Kirk; while it cannot be denied [that] if it is
wanting in that characteristic quality, the aspect of common life, so
far as concerns its beauty, must suffer. Sincere Christian piety may be
thought not to stand in need of refinement or studied ornament, but
assuredly it is ever ready to adopt them, when they fall within its
notice, as means allow: and this observation applies not only to
manners, but to everything that a Christian (truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>{142}</span> so in spirit)
cultivates and gathers round him, however humble his social condition.</p>

<p>We were detained, by incessant rain and storm, at the small inn near
Roslin Chapel, and I passed a great part of the day pacing to and fro in
this beautiful structure, which, though not used for public service, is
not allowed to go to ruin. Here this sonnet was composed, and [I shall
be fully satisfied] if it has at all done justice to the feeling which
the place and the storm raging without inspired. I was as a prisoner. A
Painter delineating the interior of the chapel and its minute features,
under such circumstances, would have no doubt found his time agreeably
shortened. But the movements of the mind must be more free while dealing
with words than with lines and colours. Such, at least, was then, and
has been on many other occasions, my belief; and as it is allotted to
few to follow both arts with success, I am grateful to my own calling
for this and a thousand other recommendations which are denied to that
of the Painter.</p>

<p>As recorded in my Sister's Journal, I had first seen the Trosachs in her
and Coleridge's company. The sentiment that runs through this sonnet was
natural to the season in which I again saw this beautiful spot; but
this, and some other sonnets that follow, were coloured by the
remembrance of my recent visit to Sir Walter Scott, and the melancholy
errand on which he was going.</p>

<p>It was mortifying to have frequent occasions to observe the bitter

<h3><a name="poem369" id="poem369" ></a>369. <i>Eagles: composed at Dunollie Castle in the Bay of Oban</i>. [IX.]</h3>

<p>The last I saw was on the wing, off the promontory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>{143}</span> Fairhead, county
of Antrim. I mention this, because, though my tour in Ireland, with Mr.
Marshall and his son, was made many years ago, this allusion to the
eagle is the only image supplied by it to the poetry I have since
written. We travelled through the country in October; and to the
shortness of the days, and the speed with which we travelled (in a
carriage-and-four), may be ascribed this want of notices, in my verse,
of a country so interesting. The deficiency I am somewhat ashamed of,
and it is the more remarkable, as contrasted with my Scotch and
continental tours, of which are to be found in these volumes so many
memorials.</p>

<p>Touring late in the season in Scotland is an uncertain speculation. We
were detained a week by rain at Bunaw, on Loch Etive, in a vain hope
that the weather would clear up, and allow me to show my daughter the
beauties of Glencoe. Two days we were at the Isle of Mull, on a visit to
Major Campbell; but it rained incessantly, and we were obliged to give
up our intention of going to Staffa. The rain pursued us to Tyndrum,
where the next sonnet was composed in a storm.</p>

<p>On ascending a hill that leads from Loch Awe towards Inverary, I fell
into conversation with a woman of the humbler class, who wore one of
these Highland broaches. I talked with her about it, and upon parting
with her, when I said, with a kindness I truly felt, 'May the broach
continue in your family for many generations to come, as you have
already possessed it,' she thanked me most becomingly, and seemed not a
little moved. The exact resemblance which the old broach (still in use,
though rarely met with among the Highlanders) bears to the Roman Fibula
must strike every one, and concurs, with the plaid and kilt, to recall
to mind the communication which the ancient Romans had with this remote
country.</p>

<p>[Note.&mdash;How much the Broach is sometimes prized by persons in humble
stations may be gathered from an occurrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>{144}</span> mentioned to me by a female
friend. She had an opportunity of benefiting a poor old woman in her own
hut, who, wishing to make a return, said to her daughter in Erse, in a
tone of plaintive earnestness, 'I would give anything I have, but I
<i>hope</i> she does not wish for my Broach!' and uttering these words she
put her hand upon the Broach which fastened her kerchief, and which she
imagined had attracted the eye of her benefactress.]</p>

<p>Upon a small island not far from the head of Loch Lomond, are some
remains of an ancient building, which was for several years the abode of
a solitary Individual, one of the last survivors of the clan of
Macfarlane, once powerful in that neighbourhood. Passing along the shore
opposite this island in the year 1814, the Author learned these
particulars, and that this person then living there had acquired the
appellation of 'The Brownie.' See 'The Brownie's Cell' ['Memorials of a

was well acquainted with it in its ancient state. The Hartshorn tree,
mentioned in the next sonnet, was one of its remarkable objects, as well
as another tree that grew upon an eminence not far from Penrith. It was
single and conspicuous, and, being of a round shape, though it was
universally known to be a 'sycamore,' it was always called the 'Round
Thorn,' so difficult is it to chain fancy down to fact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>{145}</span></p>

imposing appearance as it stood, in a decayed state, by the side of the
high road leading from Penrith to Appleby. The whole neighbourhood
abounds in interesting traditions and vestiges of antiquity, viz.,
Julian's Bower; Brougham and Penrith Castles; Penrith Beacon, and the
curious remains in Penrith Churchyard; Arthur's Round Table, and, close

<h3><a name="poem380" id="poem380" ></a>380. <i>Lines composed on a high part of the coast of Cumberland, Easter
Sunday, April 7th, the Author's sixty-third birthday</i>. [II.]</h3>

<p>The lines were composed on the road between Moresby and Whitehaven,
while I was on a visit to my son, then rector of Moresby. This
succession of Voluntaries, with the exception of the 8th and 9th,
originated in the concluding lines of the last paragraph of this poem.
With this coast I have been familiar from my earliest childhood, and
remember being struck for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>{146}</span> first time by the town and port of
Whitehaven, and the white waves breaking against its quays and piers, as
the whole came into view from the top of the high ground down which the
road,&mdash;which has since been altered,&mdash;then descended abruptly. My
sister, when she first heard the voice of the sea from this point, and
beheld the scene spread before her, burst into tears. Our family then
lived at Cockermouth, and this fact was often mentioned among us as
indicating the sensibility for which she was so remarkable.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem381" id="poem381" ></a>381. *<i>By the Sea-side</i>. [III.]</h3>

<p>These lines were suggested during my residence under my son's roof at
Moresby on the coast near Whitehaven, at the time when I was composing
those verses among the Evening Voluntaries that have reference to the
Sea. In some future edition I purpose to place it among that class of
poems. It was in that neighbourhood I first became acquainted with the
ocean and its appearances and movements. My infancy and early childhood
were passed at Cockermouth, about eight miles from the coast, and I well
remember that mysterious awe with which I used to listen to anything
said about storms and shipwrecks. Sea-shells of many descriptions were
common in the town, and I was not a little surprised when I heard Mr.
Landor had denounced me as a Plagiarist from himself for having
described a boy applying a sea-shell to his ear, and listening to it for
intimation of what was going on in its native element. This I had done
myself scores of times, and it was a belief among us that we could know
from the sound whether the tide was ebbing or flowing.</p>

<p>Having been prevented by the lateness of the season, in 1831, from
visiting Staffa and Iona, the author made these the principal objects of
a short tour in the summer of 1833, of which the following series of
poems is a Memorial. The course pursued was down the Cumberland river
Derwent, and to Whitehaven; thence (by the Isle of Man, where a few days
were passed,) up the Frith of Clyde to Greenock, then to Oban, Staffa,
Iona, and back towards England by Loch Awe, Inverary, Loch Goil-head,
Greenock, and through parts of Renfrewshire, Ayrshire, and Dumfriesshire
to Carlisle, and thence up the River Eden, and homeward by Ullswater.</p>

<h3><a name="poem389" id="poem389" ></a>389. <i>The Greta</i>.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'But if thou, like Cocytus,' &amp;c. (IV. l. 5).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many years ago, when I was at Greta Bridge, in Yorkshire, the hostess of
the inn, proud of her skill in etymology, said, that 'the name of the
river was taken from the <i>bridge</i>, the form of which, as every one must
notice, exactly resembled a great A.' Dr. Whitaker has derived it from
the word of common occurrence in the north of England, '<i>to greet</i>;'
signifying to lament aloud, mostly with weeping; a conjecture rendered
more probable from the stony and rocky channel of both the Cumberland
and Yorkshire rivers. The Cumberland Greta, though it does not, among
the country people, take up <i>that</i> name till within three miles of its
disappearance in the river Derwent, may be considered as having its
source in the mountain cove of Wythburn, and flowing through Thirlmere,
the beautiful features of which lake are known only to those who,
travelling between Grasmere and Keswick, have quitted the main road in
the vale of Wythburn, and, crossing over to the opposite side of the
lake, have proceeded with it on the right hand.</p>

<p>The channel of the Greta, immediately above Keswick, has, for the
purposes of building, been in a great measure cleared of the immense
stones which, by their concussion in high floods, produced the loud and
awful noises described in the sonnet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>{149}</span></p>

<p>'The scenery upon this river,' says Mr. Southey in his Colloquies,

odd anecdote to relate of the Nun's Well. One day the landlady of a
public house, a field's length from it, on the road-side, said to me,
'You have been to see the Nun's Well, sir.' 'The Nun's Well! What is
that?' said the postman, who in his royal livery stopt his mail-car at
the door. The landlady and I explained to him what the name meant, and
what sort of people the nuns were. A countryman who was standing by
rather tipsy stammered out, 'Ay, those Nuns were good people; they are
gone, but we shall soon have them back again.' The Reform mania was just

Workington Hall (where she was received by Sir Henry Curwen as became

<p>N.B. The Poem of St. Bees to follow at this place.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem395" id="poem395" ></a>395. <i>St. Bees and Charlotte Smith</i>. [XI.]</h3>

<p>St. Bees' Heads, anciently called the Cliff of Baruth, are a conspicuous
sea-mark for all vessels sailing in the N.E. parts of the Irish Sea. In
a bay, one side of which is formed by the southern headland, stands the
village of St. Bees; a place distinguished, from very early times, for
its religious and scholastic foundations.</p>

<p>'St. Bees,' say Nicholson and Burns, 'had its name from Bega, an holy
woman from Ireland, who is said to have founded here, about the year of
our Lord 650, a small monastery, where afterwards a church was built in
memory of her.</p>

<p>'The aforesaid religious house, being destroyed by the Danes, was
restored by William de Meschiens, son of Ranulph, and brother of Ranulph
de Meschiens, first Earl of Cumberland after the Conquest; and made a
cell of a prior and six Benedictine monks to the Abbey of St. Mary at
York.'</p>

<p>Several traditions of miracles, connected with the foundation of the
first of these religious houses, survive among the people of the
neighbourhood; one of which is alluded to in these Stanzas; and another,
of a somewhat bolder and more peculiar character, has furnished the
subject of a spirited poem by the Rev. R. Parkinson, M.A., late Divinity
Lecturer of St. Bees' College, and now Fellow of the Collegiate Church
of Manchester.</p>

<p>After the dissolution of the monasteries, Archbishop Grindal founded a
free school at St. Bees, from which the counties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>{151}</span> Cumberland and
Westmoreland have derived great benefit; and recently, under the
patronage of the Earl of Lonsdale, a college has been established there
for the education of ministers for the English Church. The old
Conventual Church has been repaired under the superintendence of the
Rev. Dr. Ainger, the Head of the College; and is well worthy of being
visited by any strangers who might be led to the neighbourhood of this
celebrated spot.</p>

<p>The form of stanza in this Poem, and something in the style of
versification, are adopted from the 'St. Monica,' a poem of much beauty
upon a monastic subject, by Charlotte Smith: a lady to whom English
verse is under greater obligations than are likely to be either
acknowledged or remembered. She wrote little, and that little
unambitiously, but with true feeling for rural Nature, at a time when
Nature was not much regarded by English Poets; for in point of time her
earlier writings preceded, I believe, those of Cowper and Burns.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem396" id="poem396" ></a>396. <i>Requiems</i>.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Are not, in sooth, their Requiems sacred ties?' (XI. l. 73.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I am aware that I am here treading upon tender ground; but to the
intelligent reader I feel that no apology is due. The prayers of
survivors, during passionate grief for the recent loss of relatives and
friends, as the object of those prayers could no longer be the suffering
body of the dying, would naturally be ejaculated for the souls of the
departed; the barriers between the two worlds dissolving before the
power of love and faith. The ministers of religion, from their habitual
attendance upon sick-beds, would be daily witnesses of these benign
results; and hence would be strongly tempted to aim at giving to them
permanence, by embodying them in rites and ceremonies, recurring at
stated periods. All this, as it was in course of nature, so was it
blameless, and even praiseworthy; since some of its effects, in that
rude state of society, could not but be salutary. No reflecting person,
however, can view without sorrow the abuses which rose out of thus
formalising sublime instincts and disinterested movements of passion,
and perverting them into means of gratifying the ambition and rapacity
of the priesthood. But, while we deplore and are indignant at these
abuses, it would be a great mistake if we imputed the origin of the
offices<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>{152}</span> to prospective selfishness on the part of the monks and clergy;
<i>they</i> were at first sincere in their sympathy, and in their degree
dupes rather of their own creed than artful and designing men. Charity
is, upon the whole, the safest guide that we can take in judging our
fellow-men, whether of past ages or of the present time.</p>

answered as far as he could my enquiries about the place and the
ceremonies held here. I found more agreeable company in some little
children, one of whom, upon my request, recited the Lord's Prayer to me,
and I helped her to a clearer understanding of it as well as I could;
but I was not at all satisfied with my own part. Hers was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>{153}</span> much better
done; and I am persuaded that, like other children, she knew more about
it than she was able to express, especially to a stranger.</p>

<p>The summit of this mountain is well chosen by Cowley as the scene of the
'Vision,' in which the spectral angel discourses with him concerning the
government of Oliver Cromwell. 'I found myself,' says he, 'on the top of
that famous hill in the Island Mona, which has the prospect of three
great, and not long since most happy, kingdoms. As soon as ever I looked
upon them, they called forth the sad representation of all the sins and
all the miseries that had overwhelmed them these twenty years.' It is
not to be denied that the changes now in progress, and the passions, and
the way in which they work, strikingly resemble those which led to the
disasters the philosophic writer so feelingly bewails. God grant that
the resemblance may not become still more striking as months and years
advance!</p>

<p>The morning of the eclipse was exquisitely beautiful while we passed the
Crag, as described in the sonnet. On the deck of the steamboat were
several persons of the poor and labouring class; and I could not but be
struck with their cheerful talk with each other, while not one of them
seemed to notice the magnificent objects with which we were surrounded;
and even the phenomenon of the eclipse attracted but little of their
attention. Was it right not to regret this? They appeared to me,
however, so much alive in their own minds to their own concerns that I
could not but look upon it as a misfortune that they had little
perception for such pleasures as cannot be cultivated without ease and
leisure. Yet, if one surveys life in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>{154}</span> its duties and relations, such
ease and leisure will not be found so enviable a privilege as it may at
first appear. Natural philosophy, painting, and poetry, and refined
taste, are no doubt great acquisitions to society; but among those who
dedicate themselves to such pursuits it is to be feared that few are as
happy and as consistent in the management of their lives as the class of
persons who at that time led me into this course of reflection. I do not
mean by this to be understood to derogate from intellectual pursuits,
for that would be monstrous. I say it in deep gratitude for this
compensation to those whose cares are limited to the necessities of
daily life. Among them, self-tormentors, so numerous in the higher
classes of society, are rare.</p>

<p>Mosgiel was thus pointed out to me by a young man, on the top of the
coach on my way from Glasgow to Kilmarnock. It is remarkable, that
though Burns lived some time here, and during much the most productive
period of his poetical life, he nowhere adverts to the splendid
prospects stretching towards the sea, and bounded by the peaks of Arran
on one part, which in clear weather he must have had daily before his
eyes. Yet this is easily explained. In one of his poetical effusions he
speaks of describing 'fair Nature's face,' as a privilege on which he
sets a high value; nevertheless, natural appearances rarely take a lead
in his poetry. It is as a human being, eminently sensitive and
intelligent, and not as a poet clad in his priestly robes and carrying
the ensigns of sacerdotal office, that he interests and affects us.</p>

<p>Whether he speaks of rivers, hills, and woods, it is not so much on
account of the properties with which they are absolutely endowed, as
relatively to local patriotic remembrances and associations, or as they
are ministerial to personal feelings, especially those of love, whether
happy or otherwise; yet it is not <i>always</i> so. Soon after we had passed
Mosgiel Farm we<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>{155}</span> crossed the Ayr, murmuring and winding through a narrow
woody hollow. His line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Auld hermit Ayr staw thro' his woods,' [=stole]<br /></span>

<p>came at once to my mind, with Irwin, Lugar, Ayr, and Doon, Ayrshire
streams over which he breathes a sigh, as being unnamed in song; and,
surely, his own attempts to make them known were as successful as his
heart could desire.</p>

<p>It is to be feared that there is more of the poet than the sound
etymologist in this derivation of the name Eden. On the western coast of
Cumberland is a rivulet which enters the sea at Moresby, known also in
the neighbourhood by the name of Eden. May not the latter syllable come
from the word Dean, <i>a valley</i>? Langdale, near Ambleside, is by the
inhabitants called Langden. The former syllable occurs in the name
Emont, a principal feeder of the Eden; and the stream which flows, when
the tide is out, over Cartmel Sands, is called the Ea&mdash;eau,
French&mdash;aqua, Latin.</p>

many upon the bank of this river than I have observed in any other parts

<h3><a name="poem414" id="poem414" ></a>414. *<i>Monument of Mrs. Howard</i>. [XXXIX.]</h3>

<p>Before this monument was put up in the chapel at Wetheral, I saw it in
the sculptor's studio. Nollekens, who, by the bye, was a strange and
grotesque figure that interfered much with one's admiration of his
works, showed me at the same time the various models in clay which he
had made one after another of the mother and her infant. The improvement
on each was surprising, and how so much grace, beauty, and tenderness
had come out of such a head I was sadly puzzled to conceive. Upon a
window-seat in his parlour lay two casts of faces; one of the Duchess of
Devonshire, so noted in her day, and the other of Mr. Pitt, taken after
his death&mdash;a ghastly resemblance, as these things always are, even when
taken from the living subject, and more ghastly in this instance (of Mr.
Pitt) from the peculiarity of the features. The heedless and apparently
neglectful manner in which the faces of these two persons were left&mdash;the
one so distinguished in London society, and the other upon whose
counsels and public conduct during a most momentous period depended the
fate of this great empire, and, perhaps, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>{157}</span> all Europe&mdash;afforded a
lesson to which the dullest of casual visitors could scarcely be
insensible. It touched me the more because I had so often seen Mr. Pitt
upon his own ground at Cambridge and upon the floor of the House of
Commons.</p>

Penrith, where I used to pass my summer holidays under the roof of my
maternal grandfather. The place is well worth visiting, tho' within
these few years its privacy, and therefore the pleasure which the scene
is so well fitted to give, has been injuriously affected by walks cut in
the rocks on that side the stream which had been left in its natural
state.</p>

over-rate its importance as an object; but, though it will not bear a

<p>This sonnet was written immediately after certain trials, which took
place at the Cumberland Assizes, when the Earl of Lonsdale, in
consequence of repeated and long-continued attacks upon his character,
through the local press, had thought it right to prosecute the
conductors and proprietors of three several journals. A verdict of libel
was given in one case; and, in the others, the prosecutions were
withdrawn, upon the individuals retracting and disavowing the charges,
expressing regret that they had been made, and promising to abstain from
the like in future.</p>

jointly. While we were making an excursion together in this part of the
Lake District, we heard that Mr. Glover the artist, while lodging at
Lyulph's Tower, had been disturbed by a loud shriek, and upon rising he
learnt that it had come from a young woman in the house who was in the
habit of walking in her sleep. In that state she had gone down stairs,
and while attempting to open the outer door, either from some
difficulty, or the effect of the cold stone upon her feet, had uttered
the cry which alarmed him. It seemed to us all that this might serve as
a hint for a poem, and the story here told was constructed, and soon
after put into verse by me as it now stands.</p>

<p>1798. Actually composed while I was sitting by the side of the brook
that runs down from the <i>Comb</i>, in which stands the village of Alford,
through the grounds of Alfoxden. It was a chosen resort of mine. The
brook fell down a sloping rock, so as to make a waterfall, considerable
for that country; and, across the pool below, had fallen a tree, an ash,
if I rightly remember, from which rose, perpendicularly, boughs in
search of the light intercepted by the deep shade above. The boughs bore
leaves of green, that for want of sunshine had faded into almost
lily-white; and from the underside of this natural sylvan bridge
depended long and beautiful tresses of ivy, which waved gently in the
breeze, that might, poetically speaking, be called the breath of the
waterfall. This motion varied, of course, in proportion to the power of
water in the brook. When, with dear friends, I revisited this spot,
after an interval of more than forty years, this interesting feature of
the scene was gone. To the owner of the place I could not but regret
that the beauty of this retired part of the grounds had not tempted him
to make it more accessible, by a path, not broad or obtrusive, but
sufficient for persons who love such scenes to creep along without
difficulty.</p>

<p>Composed in front of Alfoxden House.</p>

<p>My little boy-messenger on this occasion was the son of Basil Montagu.
The larch mentioned in the first stanza was standing when I revisited
the place in May, 1841, more than forty years after. I was disappointed
that it had not improved in appearance, as to size, nor had it acquired
anything of the majesty of age, which, even though less perhaps than any
other tree, the larch sometimes does. A few score yards from this tree
grew, when we inhabited Alfoxden, one of the most remarkable beech-trees
ever seen. The ground sloped both towards and from it. It was of immense
size, and threw out arms that struck into the soil like those of the
banyan-tree, and rose again<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>{160}</span> from it. Two of the branches thus inserted
themselves twice, which gave to each the appearance of a serpent moving
along by gathering itself up in folds. One of the large boughs of this
tree had been torn off by the wind before we left Alfoxden, but five
remained. In 1841 we could barely find the spot where the tree had
stood. So remarkable a production of nature could not have been wilfully
destroyed.</p>

<p>This old man had been huntsman to the Squires of Alfoxden, which, at the
time we occupied it, belonged to a minor. The old man's cottage stood
upon the Common, a little way from the entrance to Alfoxden Park. But
[in 1841] it had disappeared. Many other changes had taken place in the
adjoining village, which I could not but notice with a regret more
natural than well-considered. Improvements but rarely appear such to
those who after long intervals of time revisit places they have had much
pleasure in. It is unnecessary to add, the fact was as mentioned in the
poem; and I have, after an interval of forty-five years, the image of
the old man as fresh before my eyes as if I had seen him yesterday. The
expression when the hounds were out, 'I dearly love their voice,' was
word for word from his own lips.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'A plague,' &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A bitter winter it was when these verses were composed by the side of my
sister, in our lodgings, at a draper's house, in the romantic imperial
town of Goslar, on the edge of the Hartz Forest. In this town the German
Emperors of the Franconian line were accustomed to keep their court, and
it retains vestiges of ancient splendour. So severe was the cold of this
winter, that when we passed out of the parlour warmed by the stove, our
cheeks were struck by the air as by cold iron. I slept in a room over a
passage that was not ceiled. The people of the house used to say rather
unfeelingly, that they expected I should be frozen to death some night;
but with the protection of a pelisse lined with fur, and a dog's-skin
bonnet, such as was worn by the peasants, I walked daily on the
ramparts, or on a sort of public ground or garden, in which was a pond.
Here I had no companion but a kingfisher, a beautiful creature that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>{161}</span>used to glance by me. I consequently became much attached to it. During
these walks I composed the poem that follows, 'The Poet's Epitaph.'</p>

<p>This and the other poems addressed to the same flower were composed at

have been censured for the last line but one, 'thy function
apostolical,' as being little less than profane. How could it be thought
so? The word is adopted with reference to its derivation, implying
something sent on a mission; and assuredly, this little flower,

time. This and other poems connected with Matthew would not gain by a
literal detail of facts. Like the wanderer in the 'Excursion,' this
schoolmaster was made up of several, both of his class and men of other
occupations. I do not ask pardon for what there is of untruth in such
verses, considered strictly as matters of fact. It is enough if, being
true and consistent in spirit, they move and teach in a manner not

<p>My sister and I were in the habit of having the teakettle in our little
sitting-room; and we toasted the bread ourselves, which reminds me of a
little circumstance not unworthy of being set down among these minutiae.
Happening both of us to be engaged a few minutes one morning, when we
had a young prig of a Scotch lawyer to breakfast with us, my dear
sister, with her usual simplicity, put the toasting-fork with a slice of
bread into the hands of this Edinburgh genius. Our little book-case
stood on one side of the fire. To prevent loss of time, he took down a
book, and fell to reading, to the neglect of the toast, which was burnt
to a cinder. Many a time have we laughed at this circumstance and other
cottage simplicities of that day. By the bye, I have a spite at one of
this series of sonnets (I will leave the reader to discover which), as
having been the means of nearly putting off for ever our acquaintance
with dear Miss Fenwick, who has always stigmatised one line of it as
vulgar, and worthy only of having been composed by a country squire.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem432" id="poem432" ></a>432. *<i>To the Spade of a Friend</i>. 1804. [XIV.]</h3>

<p>This person was Thomas Wilkinson, a Quaker by religious profession; by
natural constitution of mind&mdash;or, shall I venture to say, by God's
grace? he was something better. He had inherited a small estate, and
built a house upon it, near Yanwath, upon the banks of the Emont. I have
heard him say that his heart used to beat, in his boyhood, when he heard
the sound of a drum and fife. Nevertheless, the spirit of enterprise in
him confined itself in tilling his ground, and conquering such obstacles
as stood in the way of its fertility. Persons of his religious
persuasion do now, in a far greater degree than formerly, attach
themselves to trade and commerce. He kept the old track. As represented
in this poem, he employed his leisure hours in shaping pleasant walks by
the side of his beloved river, where he also built something between a
hermitage and a summer-house, attaching to it inscriptions, after the
manner of Shenstone at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>{163}</span> Leasowes. He used to travel from time to
time, partly from love of Nature, and partly with religious friends, in
the service of humanity. His admiration of genius in every department
did him much honour. Through his connection with the family in which
Edmund Burke was educated, he became acquainted with that great man, who
used to receive him with great kindness and condescension; and many
times have I heard Wilkinson speak of those interesting interviews. He
was honoured also by the friendship of Elizabeth Smith, and of Thomas
Clarkson and his excellent wife, and was much esteemed by Lord and Lady
Lonsdale, and every member of that family. Among his verses (he wrote
many), are some worthy of preservation; one little poem in particular,
upon disturbing, by prying curiosity, a bird while hatching her young in
his garden. The latter part of this innocent and good man's life was
melancholy. He became blind, and also poor, by becoming surety for some
of his relations. He was a bachelor. He bore, as I have often witnessed,
his calamities with unfailing resignation. I will only add, that while
working in one of his fields, he unearthed a stone of considerable size,
then another, and then two more; and observing that they had been placed
in order, as if forming the segment of a circle, he proceeded carefully
to uncover the soil, and brought into view a beautiful Druid's temple,
of perfect, though small dimensions. In order to make his farm more
compact, he exchanged this field for another, and, I am sorry to add,
the new proprietor destroyed this interesting relic of remote ages for
some vulgar purpose. The fact, so far as concerns Thomas Wilkinson, is
mentioned in the note on a sonnet on 'Long Meg and her Daughters.'</p>

<p>These verses were thrown off extempore upon leaving Mr. Luff's house at
Fox Ghyll one evening. The good woman is not disposed to look at the
bright side of things, and there happened to be present certain ladies
who had reached the point of life where <i>youth</i> is ended, and who seemed
to contend with each other in expressing their dislike of the country
and the climate. One of them had been, heard to say she could not endure
a country where there was 'neither sunshine nor cavaliers.' [In pencil

<h3><a name="poem434" id="poem434" ></a>434. *<i>An Incident characteristic of a favourite Dog</i>. [XVI.]</h3>

<p>This dog I knew well. It belonged to Mrs. Wordsworth's brother, Mr.
Thomas Hutchinson, who then lived at Sockburn-on-the-Tees, a beautiful
retired situation, where I used to visit him and his sisters before my
marriage. My sister and I spent many months there after my return from
Germany in 1799.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem435" id="poem435" ></a>435. <i>Tribute to the Memory of the same Dog</i>. [XVII.]</h3>

<p>Was written at the same time, 1805. The dog Music died, aged and blind,
by falling into a draw-well at Gallow Hill, to the great grief of the
family of the Hutchinsons, who, as has been before mentioned, had
removed to that place from Sockburn.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem436" id="poem436" ></a>436. <i>Fidelity</i>. [XVIII.]</h3>

<p>The young man whose death gave occasion to this poem was named Charles
Gough, and had come early in the Spring to Patterdale for the sake of
angling. While attempting to cross over Helvellyn to Grasmere he slipped
from a steep part of the rock where the ice was not thawed, and
perished. His body was discovered as described in this poem. Walter
Scott heard of the accident, and both he and I, without either of us
knowing that the other had taken up the subject, each wrote a poem in
admiration of the dog's fidelity. His contains a most beautiful stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'How long didst thou think that his silence was slumber!<br /></span>
<span>When the wind waved his garment how oft didst thou start!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I will add that the sentiment in the last four lines of the last stanza
of my verses was uttered by a shepherd with such exactness, that a
traveller, who afterwards reported his account in print, was induced to
question the man whether he had read them, which he had not.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem437" id="poem437" ></a>437. *<i>Ode to Duty</i>. [XIX.]</h3>

<p>This Ode, written in 1805, is on the model of Gray's 'Ode to Adversity,'
which is copied from Horace's 'Ode to Fortune.'</p>

<p>Many and many a time have I been twitted by my wife and sister for
having forgotten this dedication of myself to the stern<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>{165}</span> law-giver.
Transgressor indeed I have been, from hour to hour, from day to day; I
would fain hope however not more flagrantly or in a worse way than most
of my tuneful brethren. But these last words are in a wrong strain. We
should be rigorous to ourselves, and forbearing, if not indulgent, to
others, and if we make comparisons at all it ought to be with those who
have morally excelled us. [In pencil&mdash;But is not the first stanza of
Gray's from a chorus of Aeschylus? And is not Horace's Ode also modelled
on the Greek?]</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem438" id="poem438" ></a>438. *<i>Character of the Happy Warrior</i>. [XX.]</h3>

<p>The course of the great war with the French naturally fixed one's
attention upon the military character; and, to the honour of our
country, there are many illustrious instances of the qualities that
constitute its highest excellence. Lord Nelson carried most of the
virtues that the trials he was exposed to in his department of the
service necessarily call forth and sustain, if they do not produce the
contrary vices. But his public life was stained with one great crime, so
that, though many passages of these lines were suggested by what was
generally known as excellent in his conduct, I have not been able to
connect his name with the poem as I could wish, or even to think of him
with satisfaction in reference to the idea of what a warrior ought to
be. For the sake of such of my friends as may happen to read this note I
will add, that many elements of the character here portrayed were found
in my brother John, who perished by shipwreck, as mentioned elsewhere.
His messmates used to call him 'the Philosopher;' from which it must be
inferred that the qualities and dispositions I allude to had not escaped
their notice. He often expressed his regret, after the war had continued
some time, that he had not chosen the Naval instead of the East India
Company's Service, to which his family connection had led him. He
greatly valued moral and religious instruction for youth, as tending to
make good sailors. The best, he used to say, came from Scotland; the
next to them from the north of England, especially from Westmoreland and
Cumberland, where, thanks to the piety and local attachments of our
ancestors, endowed, or, as they are called, free-schools abound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>{166}</span></p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem439" id="poem439" ></a>439. *<i>The Force of Prayer</i>. [XXI.]</h3>

<p>An appendage to 'The White Doe.' My friend, Mr. Rogers, has also written
on the subject. The story is preserved in Dr. Whitaker's <i>History of
Craven</i>, a topographical writer of first-rate merit in all that concerns
the past; but such was his aversion from the modern spirit, as shown in
the spread of manufactories in those districts of which he treated, that
his readers are left entirely ignorant, both of the progress of these
arts, and their real bearing upon the comfort, virtues, and happiness of
the inhabitants.</p>

<p>While wandering on foot through the fertile valleys, and over the
moorlands of the Apennine that divides Yorkshire from Lancashire, I used
to be delighted with observing the number of substantial cottages that
had sprung up on every side, each having its little plot of fertile
ground, won from the surrounding waste. A bright and warm fire, if
needed, was always to be found in these dwellings. The father was at his
loom, the children looked healthy and happy. Is it not to be feared that
the increase of mechanic power has done away with many of these
blessings, and substituted many evils? Alas, if these evils grow, how
are they to be checked, and where is the remedy to be found? Political
economy will not supply it, that is certain. We must look to something
deeper, purer, and higher.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem440" id="poem440" ></a>440. *<i>A Fact and an Imagination</i>. [XXII.]</h3>

<p>The first and last four lines of this poem each make a sonnet, and were
composed as such. But I thought that by intermediate lines they might be
connected so as to make a whole. One or two expressions are taken from
Milton's <i>History of England</i>.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem441" id="poem441" ></a>441. *<i>A little Onward</i>. [XXIII.]</h3>

<p>The complaint in my eyes which gave occasion to this address to my
daughter first showed itself as a consequence of inflammation, caught at
the top of Kirkstone, when I was over-heated by having carried up the
ascent my eldest son, a lusty infant. Frequently has the disease
recurred since, leaving the eyes in a state which has often prevented my
reading for months, and makes me at this day incapable of bearing
without injury<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>{167}</span> any strong light by day or night. My acquaintance with
books has therefore been far short of my wishes, and on this account, to
acknowledge the services daily and hourly done me by my family and
friends, this note is written.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem442" id="poem442" ></a>442. <i>Ode to Lycoris</i>. [XXIV.]</h3>

<p>This, as well as the preceding and the two that follow, were composed in
front of Rydal Mount, and during my walks in the neighbourhood.
Nine-tenths of my verses have been murmured out in the open air. And
here let me repeat what I believe has already appeared in print. One day
a stranger, having walked round the garden and grounds of Rydal Mount,
asked of one of the female servants, who happened to be at the door,
permission to see her master's Study. 'This,' said she, leading him
forward, 'is my master's library, where he keeps his books; but his
study is out of doors.' After a long absence from home, it has more than
once happened that some one of my cottage neighbours (not of the
double-coach-house cottages) has said, 'Well, there he is; we are glad
to hear him <i>booing</i> about again.' Once more, in excuse for so much
egotism, let me say these notes are written for my familiar friends, and
at their earnest request. Another time a gentleman, whom James had
conducted through the grounds, asked him what kind of plants throve best
there. After a little consideration, he answered, 'Laurels.' 'That is,'
said the stranger, 'as it should be. Don't you know that the laurel is
the emblem of poetry, and that poets used, on public occasions, to be
crowned with it?' James stared when the question was first put, but was
doubtless much pleased with the information.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem443" id="poem443" ></a>443. *<i>Ibid.</i></h3>

<p>The discerning reader who is aware that in the poem of 'Ellen Irwin' I
was desirous of throwing the reader at once out of the old ballad, so as
if possible to preclude a comparison between that mode of dealing with
the subject and the mode I meant to adopt, may here, perhaps, perceive
that this poem originated in the four last lines of the first stanza.
These specks of snow reflected in the lake, and so transferred, as it
were, to the subaqueous sky, reminded me of the swans which the fancy of
the ancient classic poets yoked to the car of Venus. Hence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>{168}</span> tenor of
the whole first stanza and the name of Lycoris, which with some readers,
who think mythology and classical allusion too far-fetched, and
therefore more or less unnatural or affected, will tend to unrealise the
sentiment that pervades these verses. But surely one who has written so
much in verse as I have done may be allowed to retrace his steps into
the regions of fancy which delighted him in his boyhood, when he first
became acquainted with the Greek and Roman Poets. Before I read Virgil I
was so strongly attached to Ovid, whose <i>Metamorphoses</i> I read at
school, that I was quite in a passion whenever I found him, in books of
criticism, placed below Virgil. As to Homer, I was never weary of
travelling over the scenes through which he led me. Classical literature
affected me by its own beauty. But the truths of Scripture having been
entrusted to the dead languages, and these fountains having been
recently laid open at the Reformation, an importance and a sanctity were
at that period attached to classical literature that extended, as is
obvious in Milton's <i>Lycidas</i>, for example, both to its spirit and form
in a degree that can never be revived. No doubt the hackneyed and
lifeless use into which mythology fell towards the close of the 17th
century, and which continued through the 18th, disgusted the general
reader with all allusion to it in modern verse. And though, in deference
to this disgust, and also in a measure participating in it, I abstained
in my earlier writings from all introduction of pagan fable,&mdash;surely,
even in its humble form, it may ally itself with real sentiment&mdash;as I
can truly affirm it did in the present case.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem444" id="poem444" ></a>444. <i>Memory</i>. [XXVIII.]</h3>

<p>The verses 'Or strayed from hope and promise, self-betrayed,' were, I am
sorry to say, suggested from apprehensions of the fate of my friend
H.C., the subject of the verses addressed to H.C. when six years old.
The piece which follows, to 'Memory,' arose out of similar feelings.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem445" id="poem445" ></a>445. <i>This Lawn</i>. [XXIX.]</h3>

<p>This lawn is the sloping one approaching the kitchen-garden, and was
made out of it. Hundreds of times have I here watched the dancing of
shadows amid a press of sunshine, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>{169}</span> beautiful appearances of
light and shade, flowers and shrubs. What a contrast between this and
the cabbages and onions and carrots that used to grow there on a piece
of ugly-shaped unsightly ground! No reflection, however, either upon
cabbages or onions. The latter, we know, were worshipped by the
Egyptians; and he must have a poor eye for beauty who has not observed
how much of it there is in the form and colour which cabbages and plants
of this genus exhibit through the various stages of their growth and
decay. A richer display of colour in vegetable nature can scarcely be
conceived than Coleridge, my sister, and I saw in a bed of potatoe
plants in blossom near a hut upon the moor between Inversneyd and Loch
Katrine. These blossoms were of such extraordinary beauty and richness
that no one could have passed them without notice. But the sense must be
cultivated through the mind before we can perceive those inexhaustible
treasures of Nature&mdash;for such they truly are&mdash;without the least
necessary reference to the utility of her productions, or even to the
laws whereupon, as we learn by research, they are dependent. Some are of
opinion that the habit of analysing, decomposing, and anatomising, is
inevitably unfavourable to the perception of beauty. People are led into
this mistake by overlooking the fact that such processes being to a
certain extent within the reach of a limited intellect, we are apt to
ascribe to them that insensibility of which they are in truth the
effect, and not the cause. Admiration and love, to which all knowledge
truly vital must tend, are felt by men of real genius in proportion as
their discoveries in Natural Philosophy are enlarged; and the beauty in
form of a plant or an animal is not made less but more apparent as a
whole by a more accurate insight into its constituent properties and
powers. A <i>Savant</i>, who is not also a poet in soul and a religionist in
heart, is a feeble and unhappy creature.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem446" id="poem446" ></a>446. <i>Humanity</i>. [XXX.]</h3>

<p>These verses and the preceding ones, entitled 'Liberty,' were composed
as one piece, which Mrs. W. complained of as unwieldy and
ill-proportioned; and accordingly it was divided into two, on her
judicious recommendation.</p>

<p>[Printed notes: 'The rocking-stones alluded to in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>{170}</span>beginning of the

ancestors, both for judicial and religious purposes. Such stones are not
uncommonly found, at this day, both in Great Britain and in Ireland.' On

<p>Written at Moresby near Whitehaven, 1833, when I was on a visit to my
son, then incumbent of that small living. While I am dictating these
Notes to my friend Miss Fenwick, Jan. 24th, 1843, the child, upon whose
birth these verses were written, is under my roof, and is of a
disposition so promising that the wishes and prayers and prophecies
which I then breathed forth in verse are, thro' God's mercy, likely to
be realised. [In pencil&mdash;Jane?]</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem449" id="poem449" ></a>449. <i>The Warning: a Sequel to the Foregoing</i>. [XXXIII.]</h3>

<p>These lines were composed during the fever spread through the nation by
the Reform Bill. As the motives which led to this measure, and the good
or evil which has attended or has risen from it, will be duly
appreciated by future historians, there is no call for dwelling on the
subject in this place. I will content myself with saying that the then
condition of the people's mind is not, in these verses, exaggerated.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem450" id="poem450" ></a>450. <i>The Labourer's Noon-day Hymn</i>. [XXXV.]</h3>

<p>Bishop Ken's Morning and Evening Hymns are, as they deserve to be,
familiarly known. Many other hymns have also been written on the same
subjects; but not being aware of any being designed for noon-day I was
induced to compose these verses. Often we had occasion to observe
cottage children carrying in their baskets dinner to their fathers
engaged with their daily labours in the fields and woods. How gratifying
would it be to me could I be assured that any portion of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>{171}</span> stanzas
had been sung by such a domestic concert under such circumstances. A
friend of mine has told me that she introduced this Hymn into a
village-school which she superintended; and the stanzas in succession
furnished her with texts to comment upon in a way which without
difficulty was made intelligible to the children, and in which they
obviously took delight; and they were taught to sing it to the tune of
the old 100th Psalm.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem451" id="poem451" ></a>451. *<i>Ode composed on May Morning</i>. [XXXVI.]</h3>

<div class="center">*<i>To May</i>. [XXXVII.]</div>

<p>These two Poems originated in these lines 'How delicate, &amp;c.' My
daughter and I left Rydal Mount upon a Tour through our mountains with
Mr. and Mrs. Carr, in the month of May 1826; and as we were going up the
Vale of Newlands I was struck with the appearance of the little chapel
gleaming through the veil of half-opened leaves, and the feeling which
was then conveyed to my mind was expressed in the stanza that follows.
As in the case of 'Liberty' and 'Humanity,' mentioned before, my first
intention was to write only one Poem; but subsequently I broke it into
two, making additions to each part, so as to produce a consistent and
appropriate whole.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem452" id="poem452" ></a>452. *<i>Lines suggested by a Portrait from the Pencil of F. Stone</i>.</h3>

<div class="center"><i>The foregoing Subject resumed</i>. [XXXIX.]</div>

<p>This Portrait has hung for many years in our principal sitting-room, and
represents J.Q. as she was when a girl. The picture, though it is
somewhat thinly painted, has much merit in tone and general effect. It
is chiefly valuable, however, from the sentiment that pervades it. The
anecdote of the saying of the monk in sight of Titian's picture was told
in this house by Mr. Wilkie, and was, I believe, first communicated to
the public in this poem, the former portion of which I was composing at
the time. Southey heard the story from Miss Hutchinson, and transferred
it to the 'Doctor;' but it is not easy to explain how my friend Mr.
Rogers, in a note subsequently added to his 'Italy,' was led to speak of
the same remarkable words having many years before been spoken in his
hearing by a monk or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>{172}</span> priest in front of a picture of the Last Supper
placed over a refectory-table in a convent at Padua. [Printed note on
XXXVIII., last line: 'The Escurial. The pile of buildings composing the
palace and convent of San Lorenzo has, in common usage, lost its proper
name in that of the Escurial, a village at the foot of the hill upon
which the splendid edifice, built by Philip the Second, stands. It need
scarcely be added, that Wilkie is the painter alluded to.' On XXXIX.:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>'In the class entitled "Musings," in Mr. Southey's Minor Poems, is one
upon his own miniature picture, taken in childhood, and another upon a
landscape painted by Gaspar Poussin. It is possible that every word of
the above verses, though similar in subject, might have been written had
the author been unacquainted with those beautiful effusions of poetic
sentiment. But, for his own satisfaction, he must be allowed thus
publicly to acknowledge the pleasure those two Poems of his friend have
given him, and the grateful influence they have upon his mind as often
as he reads them or thinks of them.']</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem453" id="poem453" ></a>453. *<i>Upon seeing a coloured Drawing of the Bird of Paradise in an
Album</i>. [XLI.]</h3>

<p>I cannot forbear to record that the last seven lines of this poem were
composed in bed, during the night of the day on which my sister S.H.
died, about six P.M., and it was the thought of her innocent and
beautiful life that through faith prompted the words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'On wings that fear no glance of God's pure sight,<br /></span>
<span>No tempest from His breath.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The reader will find two Poems on pictures of this bird among my Poems.
I will here observe, that in a far greater number of instances than have
been mentioned in these Notes one Poem has, as in this case, grown out
of another, either because I felt the subject had been inadequately
treated or that the thoughts and images suggested in course of
composition have been such as I found interfered with the unity
indispensable to every work of art, however humble in character.</p>

<p>These lines were written several years ago, when reports prevailed of
cruelties committed in many parts of America, by men making a law of
their own passions. A far more formidable, as being a more deliberate
mischief, has appeared among those States, which have lately broken
faith with the public creditor in a manner so infamous. I cannot,
however, but look at both evils under a similar relation to inherent
good, and hope that the time is not distant when our brethren of the

no longer applicable. It will be gratifying to Americans and Englishmen
(indignos fraternum rumpere foedus) to read the following particulars
communicated in a letter from Mr. Reed, dated October 28, 1850. 'In Mr.
Wordsworth's letters to me you will have observed that a good deal is
said on the Pennsylvania Loans, a subject in which, as you are aware, he
was interested for his friends rather than for himself. Last December,
when I learned that a new edition of his poems was in press, I wrote to
him (it was my last letter) to say frankly that his Sonnet "To
Pennsylvanians" <i>was no longer just</i>, and to desire him <i>not to let</i> it
stand so for after time. It was very gratifying to me on receiving a
copy of the new edition, which was not till after his death, to find the
'<i>additional note</i>' at the end of the fifth volume, showing by its being
printed on the unusual place of a fly-leaf, that he had been anxious to
attend to such a request. It was characteristic of that righteousness
which distinguished him as an author; and it has this interest (as I
conjecture) that it was probably the last sentence he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>{174}</span>composed for the

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Feb. 23. 1842.</span><br />
</p>

<p>MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>I was truly pleased with the receipt of the letter which you were put
upon writing by the perusal of my 'Penal Sonnets' in the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>. Being much engaged at present, I might have deferred making my
acknowledgments for this and other favours (particularly your 'Descant')
if I had not had a special occasion for addressing you at this moment. A
Bristol lady has kindly undertaken to be the bearer of the walking-stick
which I spoke to you of some time since. It was cut from a holly-tree
planted in our garden by my own hand.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Your 'Descant' amused me, but I must protest against your system, which
would discard punctuation to the extent you propose. It would, I think,
destroy the harmony of blank verse when skilfully written. What would
become of the pauses at the third syllable followed by an <i>and</i>, or any
such word, without the rest which a comma, when consistent with the
sense, calls upon the reader to make, and which being made, he starts
with the weak syllable that follows, as from the beginning of a verse? I
am sure Milton would have supported me in this opinion. Thomson wrote
his blank verse before his ear was formed as it was when he wrote the
'Castle of Indolence,' and some of his short rhyme poems. It was,
therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>{175}</span> rather hard in you to select him as an instance of
punctuation abused. I am glad that you concur in my view on the
<i>Punishment of Death</i>. An outcry, as I expected, has been raised against
me by weak-minded humanitarians. What do you think of one person having
opened a battery of nineteen fourteen-pounders upon me, <i>i.e.</i> nineteen
sonnets, in which he gives himself credit for having blown me and my
system to atoms? Another sonneteer has had a solitary shot at me from
Ireland.</p>

<h3><a name="poem459" id="poem459" ></a>459. <i>Epistle to Sir G. H. Beaumont, Bart</i>.[1.]</h3>

<p>From the South-west Coast of Cumberland,&mdash;1811. This poem opened, when
first written, with a paragraph that has been transferred as an
introduction to the first series of my 'Scotch Memorials.' The journey,
of which the first part is here described, was from Grasmere to Bootle,
on the south-west coast of Cumberland, the whole along mountain-roads,
through a beautiful country, and we had fine weather. The verses end
with our breakfast at the Head of Yewdale, in a yeoman's house, which,
like all the other property in that sequestered vale, has passed, or is
passing, into the hands of Mr. James Marshall, of Monk Coniston, in Mr.
Knott's, the late owner's time, called Waterhead. Our hostess married a
Mr. Oldfield, a lieutenant in the navy; they lived together for some
time at Hackett, where she still resides as his widow. It was in front
of that house, on the mountain-side, near which stood the peasant who,
while we were passing at a distance, saluted us, waving a kerchief in
his hand, as described in the poem. The dog which we met soon after our
starting, had belonged to Mr. Rowlandson, who for forty years was curate
at Grasmere, in place of the rector, who lived to extreme old age, in a
state of insanity. Of this Mr. R. much might be said, both with
reference to his character, and the way in which he was regarded by his
parishioners. He was a man of a robust frame, had a firm voice and
authoritative manner, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>{176}</span> strong natural talents, of which he was
himself conscious, for he has been heard to say (it grieves me to add
with an oath), 'If I had been brought up at college by &mdash;&mdash; I should have
been a Bishop.' Two vices used to struggle in him for mastery, avarice
and the love of strong drink. But avarice, as is common in like cases,
always got the better of its opponent, for though he was often
intoxicated it was never, I believe, at his own expense. As has been
said of one in a more exalted station, he could take any <i>given</i>
quantity. I have heard a story of him which is worth the telling. One
Summer's morning our Grasmere curate, after a night's carouse in the
Vale of Langdale, on his return home having reached a point near which
the whole Vale of Grasmere might be seen with the Lake immediately below
him, he stept aside and sat down upon the turf. After looking for some
time at the landscape, then in the perfection of its morning beauty, he
exclaimed, 'Good God! that I should have led so long such a life in such
a place!' This no doubt was deeply felt by him at the time, but I am not
authorised to say that any noticeable amendment followed. Penuriousness
strengthened upon him as his body grew feebler with age. He had
purchased property and kept some land in his own hands, but he could not
find in his heart to lay out the necessary hire for labourers at the
proper season, and consequently he has often been seen in half dotage
working his hay in the month of November by moonlight&mdash;a melancholy
sight, which I myself have witnessed. Notwithstanding all that has been
said, this man, on account of his talents and superior education, was
looked up to by his parishioners, who, without a single exception, lived
at that time (and most of them upon their own small inheritances) in a
state of republican equality, a condition favourable to the growth of
kindly feelings among them, and, in a striking degree, exclusive to
temptations to gross vice and scandalous behaviour. As a pastor, their
curate did little or nothing for them; but what could more strikingly
set forth the efficacy of the Church of England, through its Ordinances
and Liturgy, than that, in spite of the unworthiness of the minister,
his church was regularly attended; and though there was not much
appearance in his flock of what might be called animated piety,
intoxication was rare, and dissolute morals unknown? With the Bible they
were, for the most part, well acquainted, and, as was strikingly shown
when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>{177}</span> were under affliction, must have been supported and comforted
by habitual belief in those truths which it is the aim of the Church to
inculcate. [Notes: 'Sled' (l.110)&mdash;a local word for sledge; 'bield' (l.
175)&mdash;a word common in the country, signifying shelter, as in Scotland.]</p>

thirty Years after its Compositon</i>. </h3>
<div class="center">Loughrigg Tarn.</div>

<p>This beautiful pool, and the surrounding scene, are minutely described
in my little book on the Lakes.</p>

<p>Sir G.H.B., in the earlier part of his life, was induced, by his love of
Nature and the art of painting, to take up his abode at Old Brathay,
about three miles from this spot, so that he must have seen it [the
Tarn] under many aspects; and he was so much pleased with it, that he
purchased the Tarn with a view to build such a residence as is alluded
to in this 'Epistle.' Baronets and knights were not so common in that
day as now, and Sir M. le Fleming, not liking to have a rival in this
kind of distinction so near him, claimed a sort of lordship over the
territory, and showed dispositions little in unison with those of Sir G.
Beaumont, who was eminently a lover of peace. The project of building
was given up, Sir G.B. retaining possession of the Tarn. Many years
afterwards, a Kendal tradesman, born upon its banks, applied to me for
the purchase of it, and, accordingly, it was sold for the sum that had
been given for it, and the money was laid out, under my direction, upon
a substantial oak fence for a certain number of yew-trees, to be planted
in Grasmere Churchyard. Two were planted in each enclosure, with a view
to remove, after a certain time, the one which throve the least. After
several years, the stouter plant being left, the others were taken up,
and placed in other parts of the same churchyard, and were adequately
fenced at the expense and under the care of the late Mr. Barber, Mr.
Greenwood, and myself. The whole eight are now thriving, and are an
ornament to a place which, during late years, has lost much of its
rustic simplicity by the introduction of iron palisades, to fence off
family burying-grounds, and by numerous monuments, some of them in very
bad taste, from which this place of burial was in my memory quite free:
see the lines in the sixth book of 'The Excursion,' beginning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>{178}</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Green is the Churchyard.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The 'Epistle,' to which these notes refer, though written so far back as
1811, was carefully revised so late as 1842, previous to its
publication. I am loath to add, that it was never seen by the person to
whom it is addressed. So sensible am I of the deficiencies in all that I
write, and so far does every thing that I attempt fall short of what I
wish it to be, that even private publication, if such a term may be
allowed, requires more resolution than I can command. I have written to
give vent to my own mind, and not without hope that, some time or other,
kindred minds might benefit by my labours; but I am inclined to believe
I should never have ventured to send forth any verses of mine to the
world, if it had not been done on the pressure of personal occasions.
Had I been a rich man, my productions, like this 'Epistle,' the 'Tragedy
of the Borderers,' &amp;c., would most likely have been confined to MS.</p>

<h3><a name="poem461" id="poem461" ></a>461. <i>Ibid.</i></h3>

<p>Loughrigg Tarn, alluded to in the foregoing Epistle, resembles, though
much smaller in compass, the Lake Nemi, or <i>Speculum Dianae</i> as it is
often called, not only in its clear waters and circular form, and the
beauty immediately surrounding it, but also as being overlooked by the
eminence of Langdale Pikes as Lake Nemi is by that of Monte Calvo. Since
this Epistle was written Loughrigg Tarn has lost much of its beauty by
the felling of many natural clumps of wood, relics of the old forest,
particularly upon the farm called 'The Oaks,' from the abundance of that
tree which grew there.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted, upon public grounds, that Sir George Beaumont did
not carry into effect his intention of constructing here a Summer
Retreat in the style I have described; as his taste would have set an
example how buildings, with all the accommodations modern society
requires, might be introduced even into the most secluded parts of this
country without injuring their native character. The design was not
abandoned from failure of inclination on his part, but in consequence of
local untowardness which need not be particularised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>{179}</span></p>

<h3><a name="poem462" id="poem462" ></a>462. *<i>Gold and Silver Fishes in a Vase</i>.[II.]</h3>

<p>They were a present from Miss Jewsbury, of whom mention is made in the
Note at the end of the next poem. The fish were healthy to all
appearance in their confinement for a long time, but at last, for some
cause we could not make out, languished; and one of them being all but
dead, they were taken to the pool under the old pollard oak. The
apparently dying one lay on its side unable to move. I used to watch it,
and about the tenth day it began to right itself, and in a few days more
was able to swim about with its companions. For many months they
continued to prosper in their new place of abode; but one night by an
unusually great flood they were swept out of the pool and perished, to
our great regret.</p>

<p>There is now, alas! no possibility of the anticipation, with which the
above Epistle concludes, being realised: nor were the verses ever seen
by the Individual for whom they were intended. She accompanied her
husband, the Rev. Wm. Fletcher, to India, and died of cholera, at the
age of thirty-two or thirty-three years, on her way from Shalapore to
Bombay, deeply lamented by all who knew her.</p>

<p>Her enthusiasm was ardent, her piety steadfast; and her great talents
would have enabled her to be eminently useful in the difficult path of
life to which she had been called. The opinion she entertained of her
own performances, given to the world under her maiden name, Jewsbury,
was modest and humble, and, indeed, far below their merits; as is often
the case with those who are making trial of their powers, with a hope to
discover what they are best fitted for. In one quality, viz., quickness
in the motions of her mind, she had, within the range of the Author's
acquaintance, no equal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>{180}</span></p>

<h3><a name="poem465" id="poem465" ></a>465. <i>Poor Robin</i>. [IV.]</h3>

<p>The small wild Geranium known by that name.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem466" id="poem466" ></a>466. *<i>Ibid.</i></h3>

<p>I often ask myself what will become of Rydal Mount after our day. Will
the old walls and steps remain in front of the house and about the
grounds, or will they be swept away with all the beautiful mosses and
ferns and wild geraniums and other flowers which their rude construction
suffered and encouraged to grow among them? This little wild flower,
'Poor Robin,' is here constantly courting my attention and exciting what
may be called a domestic interest with the varying aspects of its stalks
and leaves and flowers. Strangely do the tastes of men differ, according
to their employment and habits of life. 'What a nice well would that
be,' said a labouring man to me one day, 'if all that rubbish was
cleared off.' The 'rubbish' was some of the most beautiful mosses and
lichens and ferns and other wild growths, as could possibly be seen.
Defend us from the tyranny of trimness and neatness, showing itself in
this way! Chatterton says of Freedom, 'Upon her head wild weeds were
spread,' and depend upon it, if 'the marvellous boy' had undertaken to
give Flora a garland, he would have preferred what we are apt to call
weeds to garden-flowers. True taste has an eye for both. Weeds have been
called flowers out of place. I fear the place most people would assign
to them is too limited. Let them come near to our abodes, as surely they
may without impropriety or disorder.</p>

<h3><a name="poem467" id="poem467" ></a>467. *<i>To the Lady le Fleming</i>. [IX.]</h3>

<p>After thanking in prose Lady Fleming for the service she had done to her
neighbourhood by erecting this Chapel, I have nothing to say beyond the
expression of regret that the architect did not furnish an elevation
better suited to the site in a narrow mountain pass, and what is of more
consequence, better constructed in the interior for the purposes of
worship. It has no chancel. The Altar is unbecomingly confined. The Pews
are so narrow as to preclude the possibility of kneeling. There is no
vestry, and what ought to have been first mentioned, the Font, instead
of standing at its proper place at the entrance, is thrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>{181}</span> into the
farthest end of a little pew. When these defects shall be pointed out to
the munificent patroness, they will, it is hoped, be corrected. [In
pencil&mdash;Have they not been corrected in part at least? 1843.]</p>

<p>'No faculty yet given me to espy the dusky shape.' Afterwards, when I
could not avoid seeing it, I wondered at this, and the more so because,

<p>Our churches, invariably perhaps, stand east and west, but why is by few
persons exactly known; nor that the degree of deviation from due east
often noticeable in the ancient ones was determined, in each particular
case, by the point on the horizon at which the sun rose upon the day of
the saint to whom the church was dedicated. These observances of our
ancestors, and the causes of them, are the subject of the following
stanzas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>{182}</span></p>

<h3><a name="poem474" id="poem474" ></a>474. <i>The Horn of Egremont Castle</i>. [XI.]</h3>

<p>This story is a Cumberland tradition. I have heard it also related of
the Hall of Hutton John, an ancient residence of the Huddlestons, in a
sequestered valley upon the river Dacor. [In the I.F. MSS. the Note runs
thus: '1806. A tradition transferred from the ancient mansion of Hutton
John, the seat of the Huddlestons, to Egremont Castle.']</p>

<p>This quatrain was extempore on observing this image, as I had often
done, on the lawn of Rydal Mount. It was first written down in the Album
of my god-daughter, Rotha Quillinan.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem477" id="poem477" ></a>477. *<i>Lines written in the Album of the Countess of Lonsdale</i>. [XV.]</h3>

<p>This is a faithful picture of that amiable Lady as she then was. The
youthfulness of figure and demeanour and habits, which she retained in
almost unprecedented degree, departed a very few years after, and she
died without violent disease by gradual decay, before she reached the
period of old age. [In pencil&mdash;Was she not 70? Mr. J.]</p>

<h3><a name="poem478" id="poem478" ></a>478. <i>The Russian Fugitive</i>. [XVII.]</h3>

<p>Peter Henry Bruce, having given in his entertaining Memoirs the
substance of this Tale, affirms that, besides the concurring reports of
others, he had the story from the lady's own mouth. The Lady Catherine,
mentioned towards the close, is the famous Catherine, then bearing that
name as the acknowledged wife of Peter the Great.</p>

<br />
<h3><a name="poem487" id="poem487" ></a>487. <i>Of the Volume in which the 'Selections' appeared</i>.</h3>

<p>Of these 'Selections' the Author wrote as follows to Professor Reed, of
Philadelphia:</p>

<p>'There has recently been published in London a volume of some of
Chaucer's tales and poems modernised. This little specimen originated in
what I attempted with the "Prioress's Tale;" and if the book should find
its way to America, you will see in it two further specimens from
myself. I had no further connection with the publication than by making
a present of these to one of the contributors. Let me, however,
recommend to your notice the "Prologue" and the "Franklin's Tale;" they
are both by Mr. Horne, a gentleman unknown to me, but are, the latter in
particular, very well done. Mr. Leigh Hunt has not failed in the
"Manciple's Tale," which I myself modernised many years ago; but, though
I much admire the genius of Chaucer as displayed in this performance, I
could not place my version at the disposal of the editor, as I deemed
the subject somewhat too indelicate, for pure taste, to be offered to
the world at this time of day. Mr. Horne has much hurt this publication
by not abstaining from the "Reve's Tale;" this, after making all
allowance for the rude manners of Chaucer's age, is intolerable, and by
indispensably softening down the incidents, he has killed the spirit of
that humour, gross and farcical, that pervades the original. When the
work was first mentioned to me, I protested as strongly as possible
against admitting any coarseness or indelicacy; so that my conscience is
clear of countenancing aught of that kind. So great is my admiration of
Chaucer's genius, and so profound my reverence for him as an instrument
in the hands of Providence for spreading the light of literature through
his native land, that, notwithstanding the defects and faults in this
publication, I am glad of it, as a mean for making many acquainted with
the original who would otherwise be ignorant of everything about him but
his name.'<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>{185}</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Call up him who left half told<br /></span>
<span>The story of Cambuscan bold.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the following Poem no further deviation from the original has been
made than was necessary for the fluent reading and instant understanding
of the Author: so much, however, is the language altered since Chaucer's
time, especially in pronunciation, that much was to be removed, and its
place supplied with as little incongruity as possible. The ancient
accent has been retained in a few conjunctions, as <i>als&ograve;</i> and <i>alw&agrave;y</i>,
from a conviction that such sprinklings of antiquity would be admitted,
by persons of taste, to have a graceful accordance with the subject. The
fierce bigotry of the Prioress forms a fine back-ground for her
tender-hearted sympathies with the Mother and Child; and the mode in
which the story is told amply atones for the extravagance of the
miracle.</p>

<p>The class of Beggars to which the Old Man here described belongs will
probably soon be extinct. It consisted of poor, and mostly old and
infirm persons, who confined themselves to a stated round in their
neighbourhood, and had certain fixed days, on which, at different
houses, they regularly received alms, sometimes in money, but mostly in
provisions.</p>

<p>Observed, and with great benefit to my own heart, when I was a child.
Written at Racedown and Alfoxden in my 23d year. The political
economists were about that time beginning their war upon mendicity in
all its forms, and by implication, if not directly, on alms-giving also.
This heartless process has been carried as far as it can go by the
AMENDED Poor Law Bill, tho' the inhumanity that prevails in this measure
is somewhat disguised by the profession that one of its objects is to
throw the poor upon the voluntary donations of their neighbours, that
is, if rightly interpreted, to force them into a condition between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>{186}</span>relief in the Union Poor House and alms robbed of their Christian grace
and spirit, as being forced rather from the avaricious and selfish; and
all, in fact, but the humane and charitable are at liberty to keep all
they possess from their distressed brethren.</p>

<p>The character of this man was described to me, and the incident upon
which the verses turn was told me by Mr. Pool, of Nether Stowey, with
whom I became acquainted through our common friend S.T.C. During my
residence at Alfoxden, I used to see a great deal of him, and had
frequent occasions to admire the course of his daily life, especially
his conduct to his labourers and poor neighbours. Their virtues he
carefully encouraged, and weighed their faults in the scales of charity.
If I seem in these verses to have treated the weaknesses of the farmer
and his transgression too tenderly, it may in part be ascribed to my
having received the story from one so averse to all harsh judgment.
After his death was found in his <i>escritoir</i> a lock of gray hair,
carefully preserved, with a notice that it had been cut from the head of
his faithful shepherd, who had served him for a length of years. I need
scarcely add that he felt for all men as brothers. He was much beloved
by distinguished persons:&mdash;Mr. Coleridge, Mr. Southey, Sir H. Davy, and
many others, and in his own neighbourhood was highly valued as a
magistrate, a man of business, and in every other social relation. The
latter part of the poem, perhaps, requires some apology, as being too
much of an echo to the 'Reverie of Poor Susan.'</p>

Pemberton), both of Birmingham. They had many children, both sons and
daughters, of whom the most remarkable was the subject of this Epitaph.
He was educated under Dawes of Ambleside, Dr. Butler of Shrewsbury, and
lastly at Trin. Coll., Cambridge, where he would have been greatly
distinguished as a scholar, but for inherited infirmities of bodily
constitution, which from early childhood affected his mind. His love for
the neighbourhood in which he was born and his sympathy with the habits
and characters of the mountain yeomanry, in conjunction with irregular
spirits, that unfitted him for facing duties in situations to which he
was unaccustomed, inclined him to accept the retired curacy of Langdale.
How much he was beloved and honoured there and with what feelings he
discharged his duty under the oppressions of severe malady is set forth,
though imperfectly, in this Epitaph.</p>

<p>On Mrs. Fermor. This lady had been a widow long before I knew her. Her
husband was of the family of the lady celebrated in the 'Rape of the
Lock,' and was, I believe, a Roman Catholic. The sorrow which his death
caused her was fearful in its character, as described in this Poem, but
was subdued in course of time by the strength of her religious faith. I
have been for many weeks at a time an inmate with her at Coleorton Hall,
as were also Mary and my sister. The truth in the sketch of her
character here given was acknowledged with gratitude by her nearest
relatives. She was eloquent in conversation, energetic upon public
matters, open in respect to these, but slow to communicate her personal
feelings. Upon these she never touched in her intercourse with me, so
that I could not regard myself as her confidential friend, and was
accordingly surprised when I learnt she had left me a legacy of 100<i>l.</i>
as a token of her esteem. See in further illustration, the second stanza
inscribed upon her cenotaph in Coleorton Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>{190}</span></p>

<p>This way of indicating the <i>name</i> of my lamented friend has been found

a person who bore the name of Palmer; and the course of the thought,
throughout, turned upon the Life of the Departed, considered as a

<p>Light will be thrown upon the tragic circumstance alluded to in this
Poem when, after the death of Charles Lamb's sister, his biographer, Mr.
Serjeant Talfourd, shall be at liberty to relate particulars which could
not, at the time when his Memoir was written, be given to the public.
Mary Lamb was ten years older than her brother, and has survived him as
long a time. Were I to give way to my own feelings, I should dwell not
only on her genius and intellectual powers, but upon the delicacy and
refinement of manner which she maintained inviolable under most trying
circumstances. She was loved and honoured by all her brother's friends,
and others, some of them strange <span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>{191}</span>characters whom his philanthropic
peculiarities induced him to countenance. The death of C. Lamb himself
was doubtless hastened by his sorrow for that of Coleridge, to whom he
had been attached from the time of their being schoolfellows at Christ's
Hospital. Lamb was a good Latin scholar, and probably would have gone to
college upon one of the School foundations but for the impediment in his
speech. Had such been his lot, he would have probably been preserved
from the indulgences of social humours and fancies which were often
injurious to himself and causes of severe regret to his friends, without
really benefiting the object of his misapplied kindness.</p>


<br />
<h3><a name="poem510" id="poem510" ></a>510. *<i>Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg</i>. [XV.]</h3>

<p>These verses were written extempore immediately after reading a notice
of the Ettrick Shepherd's death in the Newcastle Paper, to the Editor of
which I sent a copy for publication. The persons lamented in these
Verses were all either of my friends or acquaintance. In Lockhart's Life
of Sir Walter Scott an account is given of my first meeting with him in
1803. How the Ettrick Shepherd and I became known to each other has
already been mentioned in these Notes. He was undoubtedly a man of
original genius, but of coarse manners and low and offensive opinions.
Of Coleridge and Lamb I need not speak here. Crabbe I have met in London
at Mr. Rogers', but more frequently and favourably at Mr. Hoare's upon
Hampstead Heath. Every Spring he used to pay that family a visit of some
length, and was upon terms of intimate friendship with Mrs. Hoare, and
still more with her daughter-in-law, who has a large collection of his
letters addressed to herself. After the Poet's decease application was
made to her to give up these letters to his biographer, that they, or at
least a part of them, might be given to the public. She hesitated to
comply, and asked my opinion on the subject. 'By no means,' was my
answer, grounded not upon any objection there might be to publishing a
selection from those letters, but from an aversion I have always felt to
meet idle curiosity by calling back the recently departed to become the
object of trivial and familiar gossip. Crabbe obviously for the most
part preferred the company of women to that of men; for this among other
reasons, that he did not like to be put upon the stretch in general
conversation. Accordingly, in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>{192}</span>miscellaneous society his talk was so
much below what might have been expected from a man so deservedly
celebrated, that to me it seemed trifling. It must upon other occasions
have been of a different character, as I found in our rambles together
on Hampstead Heath; and not so much so from a readiness to communicate
his knowledge of life and manners as of natural history in all its
branches. His mind was inquisitive, and he seems to have taken refuge
from a remembrance of the distresses he had gone through in these
studies and the employments to which they led. Moreover such
contemplations might tend profitably to counterbalance the painful
truths which he had collected from his intercourse with mankind. Had I
been more intimate with him I should have ventured to touch upon his
office as a Minister of the Gospel, and how far his heart and soul were
in it, so as to make him a zealous and diligent labourer. In poetry,
tho' he wrote much, as we all know, he assuredly was not so. I happened
once to speak of pains as necessary to produce merit of a certain kind
which I highly valued. His observation was, 'It is not worth while.' You
are right, thought I, if the labour encroaches upon the time due to
teach truth as a steward of the mysteries of God; but if poetry is to be
produced at all, make what you do produce as good as you can. Mr. Rogers
once told me that he expressed his regret to Crabbe that he wrote in his
late works so much less correctly than in his earlier. 'Yes,' replied
he, 'but then I had a reputation to make; now I can afford to relax.'
Whether it was from a modest estimate of his own qualifications or from
causes less creditable, his motives for writing verse and his hopes and
aims were not so high as is to be desired. After being silent for more
than twenty years he again applied himself to poetry, upon the spur of
applause he received from the periodical publications of the day, as he
himself tells us in one of his Prefaces. Is it not to be lamented that a
man who was so conversant with permanent truth, and whose writings are
so valuable an acquisition to our country's literature, should have
<i>required</i> an impulse from such a quarter?<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>{193}</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hemans was unfortunate as a Poetess in being obliged by
circumstances to write for money, and that so frequently and so much,
that she was compelled to look out for subjects wherever she could find
them, and to write as expeditiously as possible. As a woman she was to a
considerable degree a spoilt child of the world. She had been early in
life distinguished for talents, and poems of hers were published whilst
she was a girl. She had also been handsome in her youth, but her
education had been most unfortunate. She was totally ignorant of
housewifery, and could as easily have managed the spear of Minerva as
her needle. It was from observing these deficiencies that one day, while
she was under my roof, I purposely directed her attention to household
economy, and told her I had purchased scales which I intended to present
to a young lady as a wedding present; pointed out their utility (for her
especial benefit), and said that no menage ought to be without them.
Mrs. Hemans, not in the least suspecting my drift, reported this saying
in a letter to a friend at the time, as a proof of my simplicity. Being
disposed to make large allowances for the faults of her education and
the circumstances in which she was placed, I felt most kindly disposed
towards her and took her part upon all occasions, and I was not a little
affected by learning that after she withdrew to Ireland a long and
severe illness raised her spirit as it depressed her body. This I heard
from her most intimate friends, and there is striking evidence of it in
a poem entitled [Blank; and in pencil on opposite page&mdash;Do you mean a
Sonnet entitled 'Sabbath Sonnet,' composed by Mrs. Hemans, April 26th,
1835, a few days before her death? 'How many blessed groups this hour
are wending!'] These notices of Mrs. Hemans would be very unsatisfactory
to her intimate friends, as indeed they are to myself, not so much for
what is said, but what for brevity's sake is left unsaid. Let it suffice
to add there was much sympathy between us, and if opportunity had been
allowed me to see more of her, I should have loved and valued her
accordingly. As it is, I remember her with true affection for her
amiable qualities, and above all for her delicate and irreproachable
conduct during her long separation from an unfeeling husband, whom she
had been led to marry from the romantic notions of inexperienced youth.
Upon this husband I never heard her cast the least reproach, nor did I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>{194}</span>ever hear her even name him, though she did not forbear wholly to touch
upon her domestic position; but never so as that any fault could be
found with her manner of adverting to it.</p>

<h3><a name="poem512" id="poem512" ></a>512. *<i>Ode: Intimations of Immortality, from Recollections of early
Childhood</i>. [Headed in I.F. MSS. 'The Ode.']</h3>

<p>This was composed during my residence at Town-End, Grasmere. Two years
at least passed between the writing of the four first stanzas and the
remaining part. To the attentive and competent reader the whole
sufficiently explains itself, but there may be no harm in adverting here
to particular feelings or <i>experiences</i> of my own mind on which the
structure of the poem partly rests. Nothing was more difficult for me in
childhood than to admit the notion of death as a state applicable to my
own being. I have said elsewhere</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">'A simple child<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That lightly draws its breath,<br /></span>
<span>And feels its life in every limb,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But it was not so much from the source of animal vivacity that <i>my</i>
difficulty came as from a sense of the indomitableness of the spirit
within me. I used to brood over the stories of Enoch and Elijah, and
almost to persuade myself that, whatever might become of others, I
should be translated in something of the same way to heaven. With a
feeling congenial to this, I was often unable to think of external
things as having external existence, and I communed with all that I saw
as something not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature.
Many times while going to school have I grasped at a wall or tree to
recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality. At that time I
was afraid of such processes. In later periods of life I have deplored,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>{195}</span>as we have all reason to do, a subjugation of an opposite character,
and have rejoiced over the remembrances, as is expressed in the lines,
'Obstinate questionings,' &amp;c. To that dreamlike vividness and splendour
which invest objects of sight in childhood, every one, I believe, if he
would look back, could bear testimony, and I need not dwell upon it
here; but having in the Poem regarded it as presumptive evidence of a
prior state of existence, I think it right to protest against a
conclusion which has given pain to some good and pious persons, that I
meant to inculcate such a belief. It is far too shadowy a notion to be
recommended to faith as more than an element in our instincts of
immortality. But let us bear in mind that, though the idea is not
advanced in Revelation, there is nothing there to contradict it, and the
fall of man presents an analogy in its favour. Accordingly, a
pre-existent state has entered into the popular creeds of many nations,
and among all persons acquainted with classic literature is known as an
ingredient in Platonic philosophy. Archimedes said that he could move
the world if he had a point whereon to rest his machine. Who has not
felt the same aspirations as regards the world of his own mind? Having
to wield some of its elements when I was impelled to write this poem on
the 'Immortality of the Soul,' I took hold of the notion of
pre-existence as having sufficient foundation in humanity for
authorising me to make for my purpose the best use of it I could as a
Poet.</p>

<p>Something must now be said of this Poem, but chiefly, as has been done
through the whole of these Notes, with reference to my personal friends,
and especially to her [Miss Fenwick] who has perseveringly taken them
down from my dictation. Towards the close of the 1st book, stand the
lines that were first written, beginning 'Nine tedious years,' and
ending 'last human tenant of these ruined walls.' These were composed in
1795, at Racedown; and for several passages describing the employment
and demeanour of Margaret during her affliction, I was indebted to
observations made in Dorsetshire, and afterwards at Alfoxden, in
Somersetshire, where I resided in 1797 and 1798. The lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>{196}</span> towards the
conclusion of the 4th book, 'Despondency corrected,' beginning 'For the
man who in this spirit,' to the words 'intellectual soul,' were in order
of time composed the next, either at Racedown or Alfoxden, I do not
remember which. The rest of the poem was written in the vale of
Grasmere, chiefly during our residence at Allan Bank. The long poem on
my own education was, together with many minor poems, composed while we
lived at the cottage at Town-End. Perhaps my purpose of giving an
additional interest to these my poems, in the eyes of my nearest and
dearest friends, may he promoted by saying a few words upon the
character of the 'Wanderer,' the 'Solitary,' and the 'Pastor,' and some
other of the persons introduced. And first of the principal one, the
'Wanderer.'</p>

<p>My lamented friend Southey (for this is written a month after his
decease<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>) used to say that had he been a Papist, the course of life
which would in all probability have been his, was the one for which he
was most fitted and most to his mind, that of a Benedictine Monk, in a
Convent, furnished, as many once were, and some still are, with an
inexhaustible library. <i>Books</i>, as appears from many passages in his
writings, and was evident to those who had opportunities of observing
his daily life, were, in fact, <i>his passion</i>; and <i>wandering</i>, I can
with truth affirm, was mine; but this propensity in me was happily
counteracted by inability from want of fortune to fulfil my wishes.</p>

<p>But had I been born in a class which would have deprived me of what is
called a liberal education, it is not unlikely that, being strong in
body, I should have taken to a way of life such as that in which my
'Pedlar' passed the greater part of his days. At all events, I am here
called upon freely to acknowledge that the character I have represented
in his person is chiefly an idea of what I fancied my own character
might have become in his circumstances.</p>

<p>Nevertheless much of what he says and does had an external existence,
that fell under my own youthful and subsequent observation.</p>

<p>An individual, named Patrick, by birth and education a Scotchman,
followed this humble occupation for many years, and afterwards settled
in the town of Kendal. He married a kinswoman of my wife's, and her
sister Sarah was brought up<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>{197}</span> from early childhood under this good man's
eye.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> My own imaginations I was happy to find clothed in reality, and
fresh ones suggested, by what she reported of this man's tenderness of
heart, his strong and pure imagination, and his solid attainments in
literature, chiefly religious, whether in prose or verse. At Hawkshead
also, while I was a school-boy, there occasionally resided a packman
(the name then generally given to this calling), with whom I had
frequent conversations upon what had befallen him, and what he had
observed during his wandering life, and, as was natural, we took much to
each other; and upon the subject of Pedlarism in general, as <i>then</i>
followed, and its favourableness to an intimate knowledge of human
concerns, not merely among the humbler classes of society, I need say
nothing here in addition to what is to be found in 'The Excursion,' and
a note attached to it.</p>

<p>Now for the <i>Solitary</i>. Of him I have much less to say. Not long after
we took up our abode at Grasmere, came to reside there, from what motive
I either never knew or have forgotten, a Scotchman, a little past the
middle of life, who had for many years been chaplain to a Highland
regiment. He was in no respect, as far as I know, an interesting
character, though in his appearance there was a good deal that attracted
attention, as if he had been shattered in for bane, and not happy in
mind. Of his quondam position I availed myself to connect with the
'Wanderer,' also a Scotchman, a character suitable to my purpose, the
elements of which I drew from several persons with whom I had been
connected, and who fell under my observation during frequent residences
in London at the beginning of the French Revolution. The chief of these
was, one may now say, a Mr. Fawcett, a preacher at a Dissenting
meeting-house at the Old Jewry. It happened to me several times to be
one of his congregation through my connection with Mr. Nicholson of
Cateaton Street, Strand, who, at a time when I had not many
acquaintances in London, used often to invite me to dine with him on
Sundays; and I took that opportunity (Mr. N. being a Dissenter) of going
to hear Fawcett, who was an able and eloquent man. He published a poem
on War, which had a good deal of merit, and made me think more about him
than I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>{198}</span> should otherwise have done. But his Christianity was probably
never very deeply rooted; and, like many others in those times of like
shewy talents, he had not strength of character to withstand the effects
of the French Revolution, and of the wild and lax opinions which had
done so much towards producing it, and far more in carrying it forward
in its extremes. Poor Fawcett, I have been told, became pretty much such
a person as I have described, and early disappeared from the stage,
having fallen into habits of intemperance, which I have heard (though I
will not answer for the fact) hastened his death. Of him I need say no
more. There were many like him at that time, which the world will never
be without, but which were more numerous then, for reasons too obvious
to be dwelt upon.</p>

<p><i>The Pastor</i>.&mdash;To what is said of the 'Pastor' in the poem, I have
little to add but what may be deemed superfluous. It has ever appeared
to me highly favourable to the beneficial influence of the Church of
England upon all gradations and classes of society, that the patronage
of its benefices is in numerous instances attached to the estates of
noble families of ancient gentry; and accordingly I am gratified by the
opportunity afforded me in 'The Excursion,' to pourtray the character of
a country clergyman of more than ordinary talents, born and bred in the
upper ranks of society so as to partake of their refinements, and at the
same time brought by his pastoral office and his love of rural life into
intimate connection with the peasantry of his native district.</p>

<p>To illustrate the relation which in my mind this 'Pastor' bore to the
'Wanderer,' and the resemblances between them, or rather the points of
community in their nature, I likened one to an oak, and the other to a
sycamore; and having here referred to this comparison, I need only add,
I had no one individual in my mind, wishing rather to embody this idea
than to break in upon the simplicity of it by traits of individual
character, or of any peculiarity of opinion.</p>

<p>And now for a few words upon the scene where these interviews and
conversations are supposed to occur.</p>

<p>The scene of the first book of the poem is, I must own, laid in a tract
of country not sufficiently near to that which soon comes into view in
the second book, to agree with the fact. All that relates to Margaret,
and the ruined cottage, &amp;c., was taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>{199}</span> from observations made in the
south-west of England, and certainly it would require more than
seven-leagued boots to stretch in one morning from a common in
Somersetshire, or Dorsetshire, to the heights of Furness Fells, and the
deep valleys they embosom. For this dealing with space, I need make, I
trust, no apology; but my friends may be amused by the truth.</p>

<p>In the poem, I suppose that the Pedlar and I ascended from a plain
country up the vale of Langdale, and struck off a good way above the
chapel to the western side of the Vale. We ascended the hill, and thence
looked down upon the circular recess in which lies Blea Tarn, chosen by
the 'Solitary' for his retreat. After we quit his cottage, passing over
a low ridge, we descend into another Vale, that of Little Langdale,
towards the head of which stands embowered, or partly shaded by yews and
other trees, something between a cottage and a mansion, or gentleman's
house, such as they once were in this country. This I convert into the
parsonage, and at the same time, and as by the waving of a magic wand, I
turn the comparatively confined Vale of Langdale, its tarn, and the rude
chapel which once adorned the valley, into the stately and comparatively
spacious Vale of Grasmere and its ancient parish church; and upon the
side of Loughrigg Fell, at the foot of the Lake, and looking down upon
it and the whole Vale and its accompanying mountains, the 'Pastor' is
supposed by me to stand, when at sunset he addresses his companions in
words which I hope my readers may remember,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> or I should not have
taken the trouble of giving so much in detail the materials on which my
mind actually worked.</p>

<p>Now for a few particulars of <i>fact</i>, respecting the persons whose
stories are told or characters described by the different speakers. To
Margaret I have already alluded. I will add here that the lines
beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'She was a woman of a steady mind,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Live on earth a life of happiness,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>faithfully delineate, as far as they go, the character possessed in
common by many women whom it has been my happiness to know in humble
life; and that several of the most touching things which she is
represented as saying and doing are taken from actual observation of the
distresses and trials under which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>{200}</span> different persons were suffering,
some of them strangers to me, and others daily under my notice.</p>

<p>I was born too late to have a distinct remembrance of the origin of the
American war; but the state in which I represent Robert's mind to be, I
had frequent opportunities of observing at the commencement of our
rupture with France in 1793; opportunities of which I availed myself in
the story of the 'Female Vagrant,' as told in the poem on 'Guilt and
Sorrow.' The account given by the 'Solitary,' towards the close of the
second book, in all that belongs to the character of the old man, was
taken from a Grasmere pauper, who was boarded in the last house quitting
the Vale on the road to Ambleside; the character of his hostess, and all
that befell the poor man upon the mountain, belongs to Paterdale. The
woman I knew well; her name was Ruth Jackson, and she was exactly such a
person as I describe. The ruins of the old chapel, among which the old
man was found lying, may yet be traced, and stood upon the ridge that
divides Paterdale from Boardale and Martindale, having been placed there
for the convenience of both districts. The glorious appearance disclosed
above and among the mountains, was described partly from what my friend
Mr. Luff, who then lived in Paterdale, witnessed upon this melancholy
occasion, and partly from what Mrs. Wordsworth and I had seen, in
company with Sir G. and Lady Beaumont, above Hartshope Hall, in our way
from Paterdale to Ambleside.</p>

<p>And now for a few words upon the church, its monuments, and of the
deceased who are spoken of as lying in the surrounding churchyard. But
first for the one picture given by the 'Wanderer' of the living. In this
nothing is introduced but what was taken from Nature, and real life. The
cottage was called Hackett, and stands, as described, on the southern
extremity of the ridge which separates the two Langdales. The pair who
inhabited it were called Jonathan and Betty Yewdale. Once when our
children were ill, of whooping-cough I think, we took them for change of
air to this cottage, and were in the habit of going there to drink tea
upon fine summer afternoons; so that we became intimately acquainted
with the characters, habits, and lives of these good, and let me say, in
the main, wise people. The matron had, in her early youth, been a
servant in a house at Hawkshead, where several boys boarded, while I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>{201}</span>was a school-boy there. I did not remember her as having served in that
capacity; but we had many little anecdotes to tell to each other of
remarkable boys, incidents, and adventures, which had made a noise in
their day in that small town. These two persons were induced afterwards
to settle at Rydal, where they both died.</p>

<p><i>Church and Churchyard</i>.&mdash;The church, as already noticed, is that of
Grasmere. The interior of it has been improved lately and made warmer by
underdrawing the roof, and raising the floor; but the rude and antique
majesty of its former appearance has been impaired by painting the
rafters; and the oak benches, with a simple rail at the back dividing
them from each other, have given way to seats that have more the
appearance of pews. It is remarkable that, excepting only the pew
belonging to Rydal Hall, that to Rydal Mount, the one to the parsonage,
and, I believe, another, the men and women still continue, as used to be
the custom in Wales, to sit separate from each other. Is this practice
as old as the Reformation? and when and how did it originate? In the
Jewish synagogues, and in Lady Huntingdon's chapels, the sexes are
divided in the same way. In the adjoining churchyard greater changes
have taken place; it is now not a little crowded with tombstones; and
near the schoolhouse, which stands in the churchyard, is an ugly
structure, built to receive the hearse, which is recently come into use.
It would not be worth while to allude to this building, or the
hearse-vehicle it contains, but that the latter has been the means of
introducing a change much to be lamented in the mode of conducting
funerals among the mountains. Now, the coffin is lodged in the hearse at
the door of the house of the deceased, and the corpse is so conveyed to
the churchyard gate. All the solemnity which formerly attended its
progress, as described in this poem, is put an end to. So much do I
regret this, that I beg to be excused for giving utterance here to a
wish that, should it befall me to die at Rydal Mount, my own body may be
carried to Grasmere Church after the manner in which, till lately, that
of every one was borne to the place of sepulchre here, namely, on the
shoulders of neighbours; no house being passed without some words of a
funeral psalm being sung at the time by the attendants bearing it. When
I put into the mouth of the 'Wanderer,' 'Many precious rites and customs
of our rural ancestry<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>{202}</span> are gone, or stealing from us,' 'this, I hope,
will last for ever,' and what follows, little did I foresee that the
observance and mode of proceeding which had often affected me so much
would so soon be superseded.</p>

<p>Having said much of the injury done to this churchyard, let me add, that
one is at liberty to look forward to a time when, by the growth of the
yew-trees thriving there, a solemnity will be spread over the place that
will in some degree make amends for the old simple character which has
already been so much encroached upon, and will be still more every year.
I will here set down, by way of memorial, that my friend Sir G.
Beaumont, having long ago purchased the beautiful piece of water called
Loughrigg Tarn, on the banks of which he intended to build, I told him
that a person in Kendal who was attached to the place wished to purchase
it. Sir George, finding the possession of no use to him, consented to
part with it, and placed the purchase-money, 20<i>l.</i>, at my disposal, for
any local use which I thought proper. Accordingly, I resolved to plant
yew-trees in the churchyard; and had four pretty strong large oak
enclosures made, in each of which was planted under my own eye, and
principally, if not entirely, by my own hand, two young trees, with the
intention of leaving the one that throve best to stand. Many years
after, Mr. Barber, who will long be remembered in Grasmere, Mr.
Greenwood (the chief landed proprietor), and myself, had four other
enclosures made in the churchyard at our own expense, in each of which
was planted a tree taken from its neighbour, and they all stand thriving
admirably, the fences having been removed as no longer necessary. May
the trees be taken care of hereafter, when we are all gone; and some of
them will perhaps, at some far-distant time, rival the majesty of the
yew of Lorton, and those which I have described as growing at
Borrowdale, where they are still to be seen in grand assemblage.</p>

<p>And now for the persons that are selected as lying in the churchyard.
But first for the individual whose grave is prepared to receive him.</p>

<p>His story is here truly related. He was a schoolfellow of mine for some
years. He came to us when he was at least seventeen years of age, very
tall, robust, and full grown. This prevented him from falling into the
amusements and games of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>{203}</span> the school; consequently, he gave more time to
books. He was not remarkably bright or quick, but, by industry, he made
a progress more than respectable. His parents not being wealthy enough
to send him to college when he left Hawkshead, he became a schoolmaster,
with a view to preparing himself for holy orders. About this time he
fell in love, as related in the poem, and every thing followed as there
described, except that I do not know exactly when and where he died. The
number of youths that came to Hawkshead school from the families of the
humble yeomanry, to be educated to a certain degree of scholarship, as a
preparation for the church, was considerable; and the fortunes of those
persons in after life various of course, and some not a little
remarkable. I have now one of this class in my eye who became an usher
in a preparatory school, and ended in making a large fortune. His
manners, when he came to Hawkshead, were as uncouth as well could be;
but he had good abilities, with skill to turn them to account, and when
the master of the school to which he was usher died, he stept into his
place, and became proprietor of the establishment. He continued to
manage it with such address, and so much to the taste of what is called
high society and the fashionable world, that no school of the kind, even
till he retired, was in such high request. Ministers of State, the
wealthiest gentry, and nobility of the first rank, vied with each other
in bespeaking a place for their sons in the seminary of this fortunate
teacher. [In pencil on opposite page&mdash;Mr. Pearson.] In the solitude of
Grasmere, while living as a married man in a cottage of 8<i>l.</i> per annum
rent, I often used to smile at the tales which reached me of the
brilliant career of this quondam clown&mdash;for such in reality he was, in
manners and appearance, before he was polished a little by attrition
with gentlemen's sons trained at Hawkshead, rough and rude as many of
our families were. Not 200 yards from the cottage in Grasmere just
mentioned, to which I retired, this gentleman, who many years afterwards
purchased a small estate in the neighbourhood, is now erecting a
boat-house, with an upper story to be resorted to as an entertaining
room when he and his associates may feel inclined to take their pastime
on the Lake. Every passenger will be disgusted with the sight of this
edifice, not merely as a tasteless thing in itself, but as utterly out
of place, and peculiarly fitted, as far as it is observed (and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>{204}</span>obtrudes itself on notice at every point of view), to mar the beauty
and destroy the pastoral simplicity of the Vale. For my own part, and
that of my household, it is our utter detestation, standing by a shore
to which, before the high road was made to pass that way, we used daily
and hourly to repair for seclusion and for the shelter of a grove, under
which I composed many of my poems&mdash;the 'Brothers' especially; and for
this reason we gave the grove that name. 'That which each man loved and
prized in his peculiar nook of earth dies with him or is changed.' So
much for my old schoolfellow and his exploits. I will only add that, as
the foundation has twice failed, from the Lake no doubt being intolerant
of the intrusion, there is some ground for hoping that the impertinent
structure will not stand. It has been rebuilt in somewhat better taste,
and much as one wishes it away, it is not now so very unsightly. The
structure is an emblem of the man. Perseverance has conquered
difficulties, and given something of form and polish to rudeness. [In
pencil on opposite page&mdash;This boat-house, badly built, gave way, and was
rebuilt. It again tumbled, and was a third time reconstructed, but in a
better fashion than before. It is not now, <i>per se</i>, an ugly building,
however obtrusive it may be.]</p>

<p>The Miner, next described as having found his treasure after twice ten
years of labour, lived in Paterdale, and the story is true to the
letter. It seems to me, however, rather remarkable, that the strength of
mind which had supported him through his long unrewarded labour, did not
enable him to bear its successful issue. Several times in the course of
my life I have heard of sudden influxes of great wealth being followed
by derangement; and, in one instance, the shock of good fortune was so
great as to produce absolute idiotcy. But these all happened where there
had been little or no previous effort to acquire the riches, and
therefore such a consequence might the more naturally be expected, than
in the case of the solitary miner. In reviewing his story, one cannot
but regret that such perseverance was not sustained by a worthier
object. Archimedes leaped out of his bath and ran about the streets,
proclaiming his discovery in a transport of joy; but we are not told
that he lost either his life or his senses in consequence.</p>

<p>The next character, to whom the priest is led by contrast with the
resoluteness displayed by the foregoing, is taken from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>{205}</span> a person born
and bred in Grasmere, by name Dawson, and whose talents, dispositions,
and way of life, were such as are here delineated. I did not know him,
but all was fresh in memory when we settled at Grasmere in the beginning
of the century. From this point the conversation leads to the mention of
two individuals, who by their several fortunes were, at different times,
driven to take refuge at the small and obscure town of Hawkshead on the
skirt of these mountains. Their stories I had from the dear old dame
with whom, as a school-boy, and afterwards, I lodged for the space of
nearly ten years. The elder, the Jacobite, was named Drummond, and was
of a high family in Scotland; the Hanoverian Whig bore the name of
Vandeput,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and might, perhaps, be a descendant of some Dutchman who
had come over in the train of King William. At all events, his zeal was
such, that he ruined himself by a contest for the representation of
London or Westminster, undertaken to support his Party, and retired to
this corner of the world, selected as it had been by Drummond for that
obscurity which, since visiting the Lakes became fashionable, it has no
longer retained. So much was this region considered out of the way till
a late period, that persons who had fled from justice used often to
resort hither for concealment, and some were so bold as to not
unfrequently make excursions from the place of their retreat for the
purpose of committing fresh offences. Such was particularly the case
with two brothers of the name of Weston, who took up their abode at Old
Brathay, I think about seventy years ago. They were highwaymen, and
lived there some time without being discovered, though it was known that
they often disappeared, in a way, and upon errands, which could not be
accounted for. Their horses were noticed as being of a choice breed, and
I have heard from the Relph family, one of whom was a saddler in the
town of Kendal, that they were curious in their saddles, and housings,
and accoutrements of their horses. They, as I have heard, and as was
universally believed, were, in the end, both taken and hanged.</p>

<p><i>Tall was her stature, her complexion dark, and saturnine</i>.&mdash;This person
lived at Town-End, and was almost our next neighbour. I have little to
notice concerning her beyond what is said in the poem. She was a most
striking instance how far a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>{206}</span> woman may surpass in talent, in knowledge,
and culture of mind, those with and among whom she lives, and yet fall
below them in Christian virtues of the heart and spirit. It seemed
almost, and I say it with grief, that in proportion as she excelled in
the one, she failed in the other. How frequently has one to observe in
both sexes the same thing, and how mortifying is the reflection!</p>

<p><i>As on a sunny bank the tender lamb</i>.&mdash;The story that follows was told
to Mrs. Wordsworth and my sister, by the sister of this unhappy young
woman. Every particular was exactly as I have related. The party was not
known to me, though she lived at Hawkshead; but it was after I left
school. The clergyman who administered comfort to her in her distress I
knew well. Her sister, who told the story, was the wife of a leading
yeoman in the Vale of Grasmere, and they were an affectionate pair, and
greatly respected by every one who knew them. Neither lived to be old;
and their estate, which was, perhaps, the most considerable then in the
Vale, and was endeared to them by many remembrances of a salutary
character, not easily understood or sympathised with by those who are
born to great affluence, past to their eldest son, according to the
practice of these Vales, who died soon after he came into possession. He
was an amiable and promising youth, but was succeeded by an only
brother, a good-natured man, who fell into habits of drinking, by which
he gradually reduced his property, and the other day the last acre of it
was sold, and his wife and children, and he himself still surviving,
have very little left to live upon; which it would not, perhaps, have
been worth while to record here, but that through all trials this woman
has proved a model of patience, meekness, affectionate forbearance, and
forgiveness. Their eldest son, who through the vices of his father has
thus been robbed of an ancient family inheritance, was never heard to
murmur or complain against the cause of their distress, and is now,
deservedly, the chief prop of his mother's hopes.</p>

<p>BOOK VII.&mdash;The clergyman and his family described at the beginning of
this book were, during many years, our principal associates in the Vale
of Grasmere, unless I were to except our very nearest neighbours. I have
entered so particularly into the main points of their history, that I
will barely testify in prose that (with the single exception of the
particulars of their journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>{207}</span> to Grasmere, which, however, was exactly
copied from real life in another instance) the whole that I have said of
them is as faithful to the truth as words can make it. There was much
talent in the family, and the eldest son was distinguished for poetical
talent, of which a specimen is given in my Notes to the Sonnets on the
Duddon. Once, when in our cottage at Town-End, I was talking with him
about poetry, in the course of our conversation I presumed to find fault
with the versification of Pope, of whom he was an enthusiastic admirer.
He defended him with a warmth that indicated much irritation;
nevertheless I would not abandon my point, and said, 'In compass and
variety of sound your own versification surpasses his.' Never shall I
forget the change in his countenance and tone of voice: the storm was
laid in a moment, he no longer disputed my judgment, and I passed
immediately in his mind, no doubt, for as great a critic as ever lived.
I ought to add, he was a clergyman and a well-educated man, and his
verbal memory was the most remarkable of any individual I have known,
except a Mr. Archer, an Irishman, who lived several years in this
neighbourhood, and who in this faculty was a prodigy: he afterwards
became deranged, and I fear continues so if alive.</p>

<p>Then follows the character of Robert Walker, for which see Nates to the
Duddon.</p>

<p>Next that of the <i>Deaf Man</i>, whose epitaph may be seen in the churchyard
at the head of Hawes-Water, and whose qualities of mind and heart, and
their benign influence in conjunction with his privation, I had from his
relatives on the spot.</p>

<p>The <i>Blind Man</i>, next commemorated, was John Gough, of Kendal, a man
known, far beyond his neighbourhood, for his talents and attainments in
natural history and science.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Infants' Grave</i> next noticed, I will only say, it is an exact
picture of what fell under my own observation; and all persons who are
intimately acquainted with cottage life must often have observed like
instances of the working of the domestic affections.</p>

<p><i>A volley thrice repeated</i>.&mdash;This young volunteer bore the name of
Dawson, and was younger brother, if I am not mistaken, to the prodigal
of whose character and fortunes an account is given towards the
beginning of the preceding book. The father of the family I knew well;
he was a man of literary education<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>{208}</span> and [considerable] experience in
society, much beyond what was common among the inhabitants of the Vale.
He had lived a good while in the Highlands of Scotland as a manager of
iron-works at Bunaw, and had acted as clerk to one of my predecessors in
the office of distributor of stamps, when he used to travel round the
country collecting and bringing home the money due to Government in
gold, which it may be worth while to mention, for the sake of my
friends, was deposited in the cell or iron closet under the west window,
which still exists, with the iron doors that guarded the property. This,
of course, was before the time of bills and notes. The two sons of this
person had no doubt been led by the knowledge of their father to take
more delight in scholarship, and had been accustomed, in their own
minds, to take a wider view of social interests, than was usual among
their associates. The premature death of this gallant young man was much
lamented, and as an attendant upon the funeral, I myself witnessed the
ceremony, and the effect of it as described in the poems, 'Tradition
tells that in Eliza's golden days,' 'A knight came on a war-horse,' 'The
house is gone.' The pillars of the gateway in front of the mansion
remained when we first took up our abode at Grasmere. Two or three
cottages still remain which are called Nott Houses, from the name of the
gentleman (I have called him a knight) concerning whom these traditions
survive. He was the ancestor of the <i>Knott</i> family, formerly
considerable proprietors in the district. What follows in the discourse
of the 'Wanderer,' upon the changes he had witnessed in rural life by
the introduction of machinery, is truly described from what I myself saw
during my boyhood and early youth, and from what was often told me by
persons of this humble calling. Happily, most happily, for these
mountains, the mischief was diverted from the banks of their beautiful
streams, and transferred to open and flat counties abounding in coal,
where the agency of steam was found much more effectual for carrying on
those demoralising works. Had it not been for this invention, long
before the present time, every torrent and river in this district would
have had its factory, large and populous in proportion to the power of
the water that could there be commanded. Parliament has interfered to
prevent the night-work which was carried on in these mills as actively
as during the daytime, and by necessity, still more perniciously; a sad
disgrace to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>{209}</span>proprietors and to the nation which could so long
tolerate such unnatural proceedings.</p>

<p>Reviewing, at this late period, 1843, what I put into the mouths of my
interlocutors a few years after the commencement of the century, I
grieve that so little progress has been made in diminishing the evils
deplored, or promoting the benefits of education which the 'Wanderer'
anticipates. The results of Lord Ashley's labours to defer the time when
children might legally be allowed to work in factories, and his
endeavours to still further limit the hours of permitted labour, have
fallen far short of his own humane wishes, and of those of every
benevolent and right-minded man who has carefully attended to this
subject; and in the present session of Parliament (1843) Sir James
Graham's attempt to establish a course of religious education among the
children employed in factories has been abandoned, in consequence of
what might easily have been foreseen, the vehement and turbulent
opposition of the Dissenters; so that for many years to come it may be
thought expedient to leave the religious instruction of children
entirely in the hands of the several denominations of Christians in the
Island, each body to work according to its own means and in its own way.
Such is my own confidence, a confidence I share with many others of my
most valued friends, in the superior advantages, both religious and
social, which attend a course of instruction presided over and guided by
the clergy of the Church of England, that I have no doubt, that if but
once its members, lay and clerical, were duly sensible of those
benefits, their Church would daily gain ground, and rapidly, upon every
shape and fashion of Dissent; and in that case, a great majority in
Parliament being sensible of these benefits, the ministers of the
country might be emboldened, were it necessary, to apply funds of the
State to the support of education on church principles. Before I
conclude, I cannot forbear noticing the strenuous efforts made at this
time in Parliament by so many persons to extend manufacturing and
commercial industry at the expense of agricultural, though we have
recently had abundant proofs that the apprehensions expressed by the
'Wanderer' were not groundless.</p>

childhood, when he had been present on such occasions in company with
his parents and nearest kindred, might have dissolved his heart into
tenderness, and so done more towards restoring the Christian faith in
which he had been educated, and, with that, contentedness and even
cheerfulness of mind, than all that the 'Wanderer' and 'Pastor' by their
several effusions and addresses had been enabled to effect. An issue

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&mdash;&mdash;'much did he see of men.' ['Excursion,' Book i. 1. 344.]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the risk of giving a shock to the prejudices of artificial society, I
have ever been ready to pay homage to the aristocracy of nature; under a
conviction that vigorous human-heartedness is the constituent principle
of true taste. It may still, however, be satisfactory to have prose
testimony how far a Character, employed for purposes of imagination, is
founded upon general fact. I, therefore, subjoin an extract from an
author who had opportunities of being well acquainted with a class of
men, from whom my own personal knowledge emboldened me to draw this
portrait.</p>

<p>'We learn from Caesar and other Roman Writers, that the travelling
merchants who frequented Gaul and other barbarous countries, either
newly conquered by the Roman arms, or bordering on the Roman conquests,
were ever the first to make the inhabitants of those countries
familiarly acquainted with the Roman modes of life, and to inspire them
with an inclination to follow the Roman fashions, and to enjoy Roman
conveniences. In North America, travelling merchants from the
settlements have done and continue to do much more towards civilising
the Indian natives, than all the missionaries, Papist or Protestant, who
have ever been sent among them.</p>

<p>'It is farther to be observed, for the credit of this most useful class
of men, that they commonly contribute, by their personal manners, no
less than by the sale of their wares, to the refinement of the people
among whom they travel. Their dealings form them to great quickness of
wit and acuteness of judgment. Having constant occasion to recommend
themselves and their goods, they acquire habits of the most obliging
attention, and the most insinuating address. As in their peregrinations
they have opportunity of contemplating the manners of various men and
various cities, they become eminently skilled in the knowledge of the
world. <i>As they wander, each alone, through <span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>{212}</span>thinly-inhabited
districts they form habits of reflection and of sublime contemplation</i>.
With all these qualifications, no wonder that they should often be, in
remote parts of the country, the best mirrors of fashion, and censors of
manners; and should contribute much to polish the roughness, and soften
the rusticity of our peasantry. It is not more than twenty or thirty
years since a young man going from any part of Scotland to England, of
purpose to <i>carry the pack</i>, was considered as going to lead the life
and acquire the fortune of a gentleman. When, after twenty years'
absence, in that honourable line of employment, he returned with his
acquisitions to his native country, he was regarded as a gentleman to
all intents and purposes.' <i>Heron's Journey in Scotland</i>, Vol. i. p. 89.</p>

<p>'A man is supposed to improve by going out into the <i>World</i>, by visiting
<i>London</i>. Artificial man does; he extends with his sphere; but, alas!
that sphere is microscopic; it is formed of minutiae, and he surrenders
his genuine vision to the artist, in order to embrace it in his ken. His
bodily senses grow acute, even to barren and inhuman pruriency; while
his mental become proportionally obtuse. The reverse is the Man of Mind:
he who is placed in the sphere of Nature and of God, might be a mock at
Tattersall's and Brooks', and a sneer at St. James's: he would certainly
be swallowed alive by the first <i>Pizarro</i> that crossed him:&mdash;But when he
walks along the river of Amazons; when he rests his eye on the
unrivalled Andes; when he measures the long and watered savannah; or
contemplates, from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>{214}</span> sudden promontory, the distant, vast Pacific&mdash;and
feels himself a freeman in this vast theatre, and commanding each ready
produced fruit of this wilderness, and each progeny of this stream&mdash;his
exaltation is not less than imperial. He is as gentle, too, as he is
great: his emotions of tenderness keep pace with his elevation of
sentiment; for he says, "These were made by a good Being, who, unsought
by me, placed me here to enjoy them." He becomes at once a child and a
king. His mind is in himself; from hence he argues, and from hence he
acts, and he argues unerringly, and acts magisterially: his mind in
himself is also in his God; and therefore he loves, and therefore he
soars.'&mdash;From the notes upon 'The Hurricane,' a Poem, by William
Gilbert.</p>

<h3><a name="letter1" id="letter1" ></a>1. <i>Autobiographical Memoranda dictated by William Wordsworth, P.L., at
Rydal Mount, November 1847</i>.</h3>

<p>I was born at Cockermouth, in Cumberland, on April 7th, 1770, the second
son of John Wordsworth, attorney-at-law, as lawyers of this class were
then called, and law-agent to Sir James Lowther, afterwards Earl of
Lonsdale. My mother was Anne, only daughter of William Cookson, mercer,
of Penrith, and of Dorothy, born Crackanthorp, of the ancient family of
that name, who from the times of Edward the Third had lived in Newbiggen
Hall, Westmoreland. My grandfather was the first of the name of
Wordsworth who came into Westmoreland, where he purchased the small
estate of Sockbridge. He was descended from a family who had been
settled at Peniston in Yorkshire, near the sources of the Don, probably
before the Norman Conquest. Their names appear on different occasions in
all the transactions, personal and public, connected with that parish;
and I possess, through the kindness of Col. Beaumont, an almery made in
1325, at the expense of a William Wordsworth, as is expressed in a Latin
inscription<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> carved upon it, which carries the pedigree of the family
back four generations from himself.</p>


<p>The time of my infancy and early boyhood was passed partly at
Cockermouth, and partly with my mother's parents at Penrith, where my
mother, in the year 1778, died of a decline, brought on by a cold, the
consequence of being put, at a friend's house in London, in what used to
be called 'a best bedroom.' My father never recovered his usual
cheerfulness of mind after this loss, and died when I was in my
fourteenth year, a school-boy, just returned from Hawkshead, whither I
had been sent with my elder brother Richard, in my ninth year.</p>

<p>I remember my mother only in some few situations, one of which was her
pinning a nosegay to my breast when I was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>{220}</span> to say the catechism in
the church, as was customary before Easter.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> I remember also telling
her on one week day that I had been at church, for our school stood in
the churchyard, and we had frequent opportunities of seeing what was
going on there. The occasion was, a woman doing penance in the church in
a white sheet. My mother commended my having been present, expressing a
hope that I should remember the circumstance for the rest of my life.
'But,' said I, 'Mama, they did not give me a penny, as I had been told
they would.' 'Oh,' said she, recanting her praises, 'if that was your
motive, you were very properly disappointed.'</p>

<p>My last impression was having a glimpse of her on passing the door of
her bedroom during her last illness, when she was reclining in her easy
chair. An intimate friend of hers, Miss Hamilton by name, who was used
to visit her at Cockermouth, told me that she once said to her, that the
only one of her five children about whose future life she was anxious,
was William; and he, she said, would be remarkable either for good or
for evil. The cause of this was, that I was of a stiff, moody, and
violent temper; so much so that I remember going once into the attics of
my grandfather's house at Penrith, upon some indignity having been put
upon me, with an intention of destroying myself with one of the foils
which I knew was kept there. I took the foil in hand, but my heart
failed. Upon another occasion, while I was at my grandfather's house at
Penrith, along with my eldest brother, Richard, we were whipping tops
together in the large drawing-room, on which the carpet was only laid
down upon particular occasions. The walls were hung round with family
pictures, and I said to my brother, 'Dare you strike your whip through
that old lady's petticoat?' He replied, 'No, I won't.' 'Then,' said I,
'here goes;' and I struck my lash through her hooped petticoat, for
which no doubt, though I have forgotten it, I was properly punished. But
possibly, from some want of judgment in punishments inflicted, I had
become perverse and obstinate in defying chastisement, and rather proud
of it than otherwise.</p>

<p>Of my earliest days at school I have little to say, but that they were
very happy ones, chiefly because I was left at liberty, then and in the
vacations, to read whatever books I liked. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>{221}</span> example, I read all
Fielding's works, <i>Don Quixote, Gil Blas,</i> and any part of Swift that I
liked; <i>Gulliver's Travels,</i> and the <i>Tale of the Tub,</i> being both much
to my taste. I was very much indebted to one of the ushers of Hawkshead
School, by name Shaw, who taught me more of Latin in a fortnight than I
had learnt during two preceding years at the school of Cockermouth.
Unfortunately for me this excellent master left our school, and went to
Stafford, where he taught for many years. It may be perhaps as well to
mention, that the first verses which I wrote were a task imposed by my
master; the subject, 'The Summer Vacation;' and of my own accord I added
others upon 'Return to School.' There was nothing remarkable in either
poem; but I was called upon, among other scholars, to write verses upon
the completion of the second centenary from the foundation of the school
in 1585, by Archbishop Sandys. These verses were much admired, far more
than they deserved, for they were but a tame imitation of Pope's
versification, and a little in his style. This exercise, however, put it
into my head to compose verses from the impulse of my own mind, and I
wrote, while yet a school-boy, a long poem running upon my own
adventures, and the scenery of the country in which I was brought up.
The only part of that poem which has been preserved is the conclusion of
it, which stands at the beginning of my collected Poems ['Dear native
regions,' &amp;c.].</p>

<p>In the month of October, 1787, I was sent to St. John's College,
Cambridge, of which my uncle, Dr. Cookson, had been a fellow. The
master, Dr. Chevallier, died very soon after;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and, according to the
custom of that time, his body, after being placed in the coffin, was
removed to the hall of the college, and the pall, spread over the
coffin, was stuck over by copies of verses, English or Latin, the
composition of the students of St. John's. My uncle seemed mortified
when upon inquiry he learnt that none of these verses were from my pen,
'because,' said he, 'it would have been a fair opportunity for
distinguishing yourself.' I did not, however, regret that <i>I</i> had been
silent on this occasion, as I felt no interest in the deceased person,
with whom I had had no intercourse, and whom I had never seen but during
his walks in the college grounds.</p>

<p>When at school, I, with the other boys of the same standing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>{222}</span> was put
upon reading the first six books of Euclid, with the exception of the
fifth; and also in algebra I learnt simple and quadratic equations; and
this was for me unlucky, because I had a full twelvemonth's start of the
freshmen of my year, and accordingly got into rather an idle way;
reading nothing but classic authors according to my fancy, and Italian
poetry. My Italian master was named Isola, and had been well acquainted
with Gray the poet. As I took to these studies with much interest, he
was proud of the progress I made. Under his correction I translated the
<i>Vision of Mirza</i>, and two or three other papers of the <i>Spectator</i>,
into Italian. In the month of August, 1790, I set off for the Continent,
in companionship with Robert Jones, a Welshman, a fellow-collegian. We
went staff in hand, without knapsacks, and carrying each his needments
tied up in a pocket handkerchief, with about twenty pounds apiece in our
pockets. We crossed from Dover and landed at Calais on the eve of the
day when the king was to swear fidelity to the new constitution: an
event which was solemnised with due pomp at Calais. On the afternoon of
that day we started, and slept at Ardres. For what seemed best to me
worth recording in this tour, see the 'Poem of my own Life.'<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>After taking my degree in January, 1791, I went to London, stayed there
some time, and then visited my friend Jones, who resided in the Yale of
Clwydd, North Wales. Along with him I made a pedestrian tour through
North Wales, for which also see the Poem.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>In the autumn of 1791 I went to Paris, where I stayed some little time,
and then went to Orleans, with a view of being out of the way of my own
countrymen, that I might learn to speak the language fluently. At
Orleans, and Blois, and Paris, on my return, I passed fifteen or sixteen
months.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It was a stirring time. The king was dethroned when I was at
Blois, and the massacres of September took place when I was at Orleans.
But for these matters see also the Poem. I came home before the
execution of the king, and passed the subsequent time among my friends
in London and elsewhere, till I settled with my only sister at Piacedown
in Dorsetshire, in the year 1796.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>{223}</span>Here we were visited by Mr. Coleridge, then residing at Bristol; and for
the sake of being near him when he had removed to Nether-Stowey, in
Somersetshire, we removed to Alfoxden, three miles from that place. This
was a very pleasant and productive time of my life. Coleridge, my
sister, and I, set off on a tour to Linton and other places in
Devonshire; and in order to defray his part of the expense, Coleridge on
the same afternoon commenced his poem of the 'Ancient Mariner;' in which
I was to have borne my part, and a few verses were written by me, and
some assistance given in planning the poem; but our styles agreed so
little, that I withdrew from the concern, and he finished it himself.</p>

<p>In the course of that spring I composed many poems, most of which were
printed at Bristol, in one volume, by my friend Joseph Cottle, along
with Coleridge's 'Ancient Mariner,' and two or three other of his
pieces.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1798, Mr. Coleridge, a friend of his Mr. Chester, my
sister, and I, crossed from Yarmouth to Hamburgh, where we remained a
few days, and saw, several times, Klopstock the poet. Mr. Coleridge and
his friend went to Ratzburg, in the north of Germany, and my sister and
I preferred going southward; and for the sake of cheapness, and the
neighbourhood of the Hartz Mountains, we spent the winter at the old
imperial city of Goslar. The winter was perishingly cold&mdash;the coldest of
this century; and the good people with whom we lodged told me one
morning, that they expected to find me frozen to death, my little
sleeping room being immediately over an archway. However, neither my
sister nor I took any harm.</p>

<p>We returned to England in the following spring, and went to visit our
friends the Hutchinsons, at Sockburn-on-Tees, in the county of Durham,
with whom we remained till the 19th of December. We then came, on St.
Thomas's Day, the 21st, to a small cottage at Town-End, Grasmere, which,
in the course of a tour some months previously with Mr. Coleridge, I had
been pleased with, and had hired. This we furnished for about a hundred
pounds, which sum had come to my sister by a legacy from her uncle
Crackanthorp.</p>

<p>I fell to composition immediately, and published, in 1800, the second
volume of the 'Lyrical Ballads.'</p>

<p>In the year 1802 I married Mary Hutchinson, at Brompton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>{224}</span> near
Scarborough, to which part of the country the family had removed from
Sockburn. We had known each other from childhood, and had practised
reading and spelling under the same old dame at Penrith, a remarkable
personage, who had taught three generations, of the upper classes
principally, of the town of Penrith and its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>After our marriage we dwelt, together with our sister, at Town-End,
where three of our children were born. In the spring of 1808, the
increase of our family caused us to remove to a larger house, then just
built, Allan Bank, in the same vale; where our two younger children were
born, and who died at the rectory, the house we afterwards occupied for
two years. They died in 1812, and in 1813 we came to Rydal Mount, where
we have since lived with no further sorrow till 1836, when my sister
became a confirmed invalid, and our sister Sarah Hutchinson died. She
lived alternately with her brother and with us.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Sept. 6, 1790, Keswill (a small village on the Lake of Constance).</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SISTER,<br />
</p>

<p>My last letter was addressed to you from St. Valier and the Grande
Chartreuse. I have, since that period, gone over a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>{225}</span> considerable
tract of country, and I will give you a sketch of my route as far as
relates to mentioning places where I have been, after I have assured you
that I am in excellent health and spirits, and have had no reason to
complain of the contrary during our whole tour. My spirits have been
kept in a perpetual hurry of delight, by the almost uninterrupted
succession of sublime and beautiful objects which have passed before my
eyes during the course of the last mouth. I will endeavour to give you
some idea of our route. It will be utterly impossible for me to dwell
upon particular scenes, as my paper would be exhausted before I had done
with the journey of two or three days. On quitting the Grande
Chartreuse, where we remained two days, contemplating, with increased
pleasure, its wonderful scenery, we passed through Savoy to Geneva;
thence, along the Pays do Vaud side of the lake, to Villeneuve, a small
town seated at its head. The lower part of the lake did not afford us a
pleasure equal to what might have been expected from its celebrity; this
owing partly to its width, and partly to the weather, which was one of
those hot gleamy days in which all distant objects are veiled in a
species of bright obscurity. But the higher part of the lake made us
ample amends; 'tis true we had some disagreeable weather, but the banks
of the water are infinitely more picturesque, and, as it is much
narrower, the landscape suffered proportionally less from that pale
steam which before almost entirely hid the opposite shore. From
Villeneuve we proceeded up the Rhone to Martigny, where we left our
bundles, and struck over the mountains to Chamouny, and visited the
glaciers of Savoy. You have undoubtedly heard of these celebrated
scenes, but if you have not read about them, any description which I
have room to give you must be altogether inadequate. After passing two
days in the environs of Chamouny, we returned to Martigny, and pursued
our mount up the Valais, along the Rhine, to Brig. At Brig we quitted
the Valais, and passed the Alps at the Simplon, in order to visit part
of Italy. The impressions of three hours of our walk among these Alps
will never be effaced. From Duomo d'Ossola, a town of Italy which lay in
our route, we proceeded to the lake of Locarno, to visit the Boromean
Islands, and thence to Como. A more charming path was scarcely ever
travelled over. The banks of many of the Italian and Swiss lakes are so
steep and rocky as not to admit of roads; that of Como is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>{226}</span> partly of
this character. A small foot-path is all the communication by land
between one village and another, on the side along which we passed, for
upwards of thirty miles. We entered upon this path about noon, and,
owing to the steepness of the banks, were soon unmolested by the sun,
which illuminated the woods, rocks, and villages of the opposite shore.
The lake is narrow, and the shadows of the mountains were early thrown
across it. It was beautiful to watch them travelling up the side of the
hills,&mdash;for several hours to remark one half of a village covered with
shade, and the other bright with the strongest sunshine. It was with
regret that we passed every turn of this charming path, where every new
picture was purchased by the loss of another which we should never have
been tired of gazing upon. The shores of the lake consist of steeps
covered with large, sweeping woods of chestnut, spotted with villages;
some clinging from the summits of the advancing rocks, and others hiding
themselves within their recesses. Nor was the surface of the lake less
interesting than its shores; half of it glowing with the richest green
and gold, the reflection of the illuminated wood and path, shaded with a
soft blue tint. The picture was still further diversified by the number
of sails which stole lazily by us as we paused in the wood above them.
After all this we had the moon. It was impossible not to contrast that
repose, that complacency of spirit, produced by these lovely scenes,
with the sensations I had experienced two or three days before, in
passing the Alps. At the lake of Como, my mind ran through a thousand
dreams of happiness, which might be enjoyed upon its banks, if
heightened by conversation and the exercise of the social affections.
Among the more awful scenes of the Alps, I had not a thought of man, or
a single created being; my whole soul was turned to Him who produced the
terrible majesty before me. But I am too particular for the limits of my
paper.</p>

<p>We followed the lake of Como to its head, and thence proceeded to
Chiavenna, where we began to pass a range of the Alps, which brought us
into the country of the Grisons at Sovozza. From Sovozza we pursued the
valley of Myssen, in which it is situated, to its head; passed Mount
Adula to Hinter Rhine, a small village near one of the sources of the
Rhine. We pursued this branch of the Rhine downward through the Grisons
to Michenem, where we turned up the other branch of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>{227}</span> river, and
following it to Chiamut, a small village near its source. Here we
quitted the Grisons, and entered Switzerland at the valley of Urseren,
and pursued the course of the Reuss down to Altorf; thence we proceeded,
partly upon the lake and partly behind the mountains on its banks, to
Lucerne, and thence to Zurich. From Zurich, along the banks of the lake,
we continued our route to Richtenschwyl: here we left the lake to visit
the famous church and convent of Einsiedeln, and thence to Glaris. But
this catalogue must be shockingly tedious. Suffice it to say, that,
after passing a day in visiting the romantic valley of Glaris, we
proceeded by the lake of Wallenstadt and the canton of Appenzell to the
lake of Constance, where this letter was begun nine days ago. From
Constance we proceeded along the banks of the Rhine to Schaffhausen, to
view the falls of the Rhine there. Magnificent as this fall certainly
is, I must confess I was disappointed in it. I had raised my ideas too
high.</p>

<p>We followed the Rhine downward about eight leagues from Schaffhausen,
where we crossed it, and proceeded by Baden to Lucerne. I am at this
present moment (14th September) writing at a small village on the road
from Grindelwald to Lauterbrunnen. By consulting your maps, you will
find these villages in the south-east part of the canton of Berne, not
far from the lakes of Thun and Brientz. After viewing the valley of
Lauterbrunnen, we shall have concluded our tour of the more Alpine part
of Switzerland. We proceed thence to Berne, and intend, after making two
or three small excursions about the lake of Neufchatel, to go to Basle,
a town in Switzerland, upon the Rhine, whence we shall, if we find we
can afford it, take advantage of the river down to Cologne, and so cross
to Ostend, where we shall take the packet to Margate. To-day is the 14th
of September; and I hope we shall be in England by the 10th of October.
I have had, during the course of this delightful tour, a great deal of
uneasiness from an apprehension of your anxiety on my account. I have
thought of you perpetually; and never have my eyes burst upon a scene of
particular loveliness but I have almost instantly wished that you could
for a moment be transported to the place where I stood to enjoy it. I
have been more particularly induced to form those wishes, because the
scenes of Switzerland have no resemblance to any I have found in
England; consequently it may probably never be in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>{228}</span> power to form an
idea of them. We are now, as I observed above, upon the point of
quitting these most sublime and beautiful parts; and you cannot imagine
the melancholy regret which I feel at the idea. I am a perfect
enthusiast in my admiration of nature in all her various forms; and I
have looked upon, and, as it were, conversed with, the objects which
this country has presented to my view so long, and with such increasing
pleasure, that the idea of parting from them oppresses me with a sadness
similar to what I have always felt in quitting a beloved friend.</p>

<p>There is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the
Swiss have always shown to their native country. Much of it must
undoubtedly have been owing to those charms which have already produced
so powerful an effect upon me, and to which the rudest minds cannot
possibly be indifferent. Ten thousand times in the course of this tour
have I regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong
impression of the beautiful forms before me; and again and again, in
quitting a fortunate station, have I returned to it with the most eager
avidity, in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture. At this
moment, when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind, I
feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my
life will pass in which I shall not derive some happiness from these
images.</p>

<p>With regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country,
the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been
unfavourable; but it must be remembered that we have had little to do
but with innkeepers, and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with
strangers. Had we been able to speak the language, which is German, and
had we time to insinuate ourselves into their cottages, we should
probably have had as much occasion to admire the simplicity of their
lives as the beauties of their country. My partiality to Switzerland,
excited by its natural charms, induces me to hope that the manners of
the inhabitants are amiable; but at the same time I cannot help
frequently comparing them with those of the French, and, as far as I
have had opportunity to observe, they lose very much by the comparison.
We not only found the French a much less imposing people, but that
politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that
you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>{229}</span>
During the time, which was near a month, that we were in France, we had
not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any
person, much less of any positive rudeness. We had also perpetual
occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the
French have always been remarkable. But I must remind you that we
crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in
consequence of the Revolution. It was a most interesting period to be in
France; and we had many delightful scenes, where the interest of the
picture was owing solely to this cause. I was also much pleased with
what I saw of the Italians during the short time we were among them. We
had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which
contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on
the other side of the Alps. It was with pleasure I observed, at a small
inn on the lake of Como, the master of it playing upon his harpsichord,
with a large collection of Italian music about him. The outside of the
instrument was such that it would not much have graced an English
drawing-room; but the tones that he drew from it were by no means
contemptible.</p>

<p>But it is time to talk about England. When you write to my brothers, I
must beg of you to give my love, and tell them I am sorry it has not
been in my power to write to them. Kit will be surprised he has not
heard from me, as we were almost upon terms of regular correspondence. I
had not heard from Richard for some time before I set out. I did not
call upon him when I was in London; not so much because we were
determined to hurry through London, but because he, as many of our
friends at Cambridge did, would look upon our scheme as mad and
impracticable. I expect great pleasure, on my return to Cambridge, in
exulting over those of my friends who threatened us with such an
accumulation of difficulties as must undoubtedly render it impossible
for us to perform the tour. Every thing, however, has succeeded with us
far beyond my most sanguine expectations. We have, it is true, met with
little disasters occasionally, but far from distressing, and they rather
gave us additional resolution and spirits. We have both enjoyed most
excellent health; and we have been so inured to walking, that we are
become almost insensible to fatigue. We have several times performed a
journey of thirteen leagues over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>{230}</span> most mountainous parts of
Switzerland without any more weariness than if we had been walking an
hour in the groves of Cambridge. Our appearance is singular; and we have
often observed, that, in passing through a village, we have excited a
general smile. Our coats, which we had made light on purpose for the
journey, are of the same piece; and our manner of carrying our bundles,
which is upon our heads, with each an oak stick in our hands,
contributes not a little to that general curiosity which we seem to
excite. But I find I have again relapsed into egotism, and must here
entreat you, not only to pardon this fault, but also to make allowance
for the illegible hand and desultory style of this letter. It has been
written, as you will see by its different shades, at many sittings, and
is, in fact, the produce of most of the leisure which I have had since
it was begun, and is now finally drawing to a conclusion, it being on
the 16th of September. I flatter myself still with the hope of seeing
you for a fortnight or three weeks, if it be agreeable to my uncle, as
there will be no necessity for me to be in Cambridge before the 10th of
November. I shall be better able to judge whether I am likely to enjoy
this pleasure in about three weeks. I shall probably write to you again
before I quit France; if not, most certainly immediately on my landing
in England. You will remember me affectionately to my uncle and aunt: as
he was acquainted with my giving up all thoughts of a fellowship, he
may, perhaps, not be so much displeased at this journey. I should be
sorry if I have offended him by it. I hope my little cousin is well. I
must now bid you adieu, with assuring you that you are perpetually in my
thoughts, and that</p>

<h3><a name="letter5" id="letter5" ></a>5. <i>In Wales</i>.</h3>

<p>'You will see by the date of this letter that I am in Wales, and whether
you remember the place of Jones's residence or no, you will immediately
conclude that I am with him. I quitted London about three weeks ago,
where my time passed in a strange manner, sometimes whirled about by the
vortex of its <i>strenua inertia</i>, and sometimes thrown by the eddy into a
corner of the stream. Think not, however, that I had not many pleasant
hours.... My time has been spent since I reached Wales in a very
agreeable manner, and Jones and I intend to make a tour through its
northern counties,&mdash;on foot, as you will easily suppose.'<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<h3><a name="letter6" id="letter6" ></a>6. <i>Melancholy of a Friend</i>.</h3>

<p>'I regret much not to have been made acquainted with your wish to have
employed your vacation in a pedestrian tour, both on your account, as it
would have contributed greatly to exhilarate your spirits, and on mine,
as we should have gained much from the addition of your society. Such an
excursion would have served like an Aurora Borealis to gild your long

<br />
<h3><a name="letter7" id="letter7" ></a>7. <i>Holy Orders</i>.</h3>

<p>About this time Wordsworth was urged by some of his relatives to take
holy orders. Writing from Cambridge, September 23rd, to Mathews, he
says: 'I quitted Wales on a summons from Mr. Robinson, a gentleman you
most likely have heard me speak of, respecting my going into orders and
taking a curacy at Harwich; which curacy he considered as introductory
to the living. I thought it was best to pay my respects to him in
person, to inform him that I am not of age for ordination.'<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>


<br />
<h3><a name="letter8" id="letter8" ></a>8. <i>The French Revolution: </i>1792.</h3>

<p>'The horrors excited by the relation of the events consequent upon the
commencement of hostilities is general. Not but that there are some men
who felt a gloomy satisfaction from a measure which seemed to put the
patriot army out of a possibility of success. An ignominious flight, the
massacre of their general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>{232}</span> a dance performed with savage joy round his
burning body, the murder of six prisoners, are events which would have
arrested the attention of the reader of the annals of Morocco.'</p>

<p>He then expresses his fear that the patriot army would be routed by the
invaders. But 'suppose,' he adds, 'that the German army is at the gates
of Paris, what will be the consequence? It will be impossible for it to
make any material alterations in the constitution; impossible to
reinstate the clergy in its ancient guilty splendour; impossible to
restore an existence to the noblesse similar to that it before enjoyed;
impossible to add much to the authority of the king. Yet there are in
France some (millions?)&mdash;I speak without exaggeration&mdash;who expect that
this will take place.'<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>


<br />
<h3><a name="letter9" id="letter9" ></a>9. <i>Failure of Louvets Denunciation of Robespierre</i>.</h3>

<p>At Paris his feelings were still more disturbed by the abortive issue of
Louvet's denunciation of Robespierre: he began to forebode the
commencement of the Reign of Terror; he was paralysed with sorrow and
dismay, and stung with disappointment, that no paramount spirit had
emerged to abash the impious crests of the leaders of 'the atheist
crew,' and 'to quell outrage and bloody power,' and to 'clear a passage
for just government, and leave a solid birthright to the state.'<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>


<br />
<h3><a name="letter10" id="letter10" ></a>10. <i>Of inflammatory Political Opinions</i>.</h3>

<p>'I disapprove of monarchical and aristocratical governments, however
modified. Hereditary distinctions, and privileged orders of every
species, I think, must necessarily counteract the progress of human
improvement. Hence it follows, that I am not among the admirers of the
British constitution. I conceive that a more excellent system of civil
policy might be established among us; yet in my ardour to attain the
goal, I do not forget the nature of the ground where the race is to be
run. The destruction of those institutions which I condemn appears to me
to be hastening on too rapidly. I recoil from the very idea of a
revolution. I am a determined enemy to every species of violence. I see
no connection, but what the obstinacy of pride and ignorance renders
necessary, between justice and the sword, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>{233}</span>between reason and bonds. I
deplore the miserable condition of the French, and think that <i>we</i> can
only be guarded from the same scourge by the undaunted efforts of good
men.... I severely condemn all inflammatory addresses to the passions of
men. I know that the multitude walk in darkness. I would put into each

<h3><a name="letter12" id="letter12" ></a>12. <i>Literary Work: Evening Walk and Descriptive Sketches</i>: 1794.</h3>

<p>In May, 1794, William Wordsworth was at Whitehaven, at his uncle's, Mr.
Richard Wordsworth's; and he then proposes to his friend Mathews, who
was resident in London, that they should set on foot a monthly political
and literary Miscellany, to which, he says, 'he would communicate
critical remarks on poetry, the arts of painting, gardening, &amp;c.,
besides essays on morals and politics.' 'I am at present,' he adds,
'nearly at leisure&mdash;I say <i>nearly</i>, for I am <i>not quite</i> so, as I am
correcting, and considerably adding to, those poems which I published in
your absence' ('The Evening Walk' and 'Descriptive Sketches'). 'It was
with great reluctance that I sent those two little works into the world
in so imperfect a state. But as I had done nothing by which to
distinguish myself at the university, I thought these little things
might show that I <i>could</i> do something. They have been treated with
unmerited contempt by some of the periodicals, and others have spoken in
higher terms of them than they deserve.'<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Writing from Keswick on November 7th, 1794, he announces to his friend
Mathews, who <i>was</i> employed on the newspapers, his desire and intention
of coming to London for the same purpose, and requests him to procure
for him a similar engagement. 'You say a newspaper would be glad of me.
Do you think you could ensure me employment in that way, on terms
similar to your own? I mean, also, in an Opposition paper, for I cannot
abet, in the smallest degree, the measures pursued by the present
ministry. They are already so deeply advanced in iniquity, that, like
Macbeth, they cannot retreat. When I express myself in this manner, I am
far from reprobating those whose sentiments differ from my own; I know
that many good men are persuaded of the expediency of the present war.'
He then turns to domestic matters: 'You would probably see that my
brother [afterwards the Master of Trinity] has been honoured with two
college declamation prizes. This goes towards a fellowship, which I hope
he will obtain, and am sure he will merit. He is a lad of talents, and
industrious withal. This same industry is a good old Roman quality, and
nothing is to be done without it.'<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<br />
<p>My dear friend,</p>

<p>My father, who was an attorney of considerable eminence, died intestate
when we were children; and the chief part of his personal property after
his decease was expended in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>{235}</span> unsuccessful attempt to compel the late
Lord Lonsdale to pay a debt of about 5000<i>l.</i> to my father's estate.
Enough, however, was scraped together to educate us all in different
ways. I, the second son, was sent to college with a view to the
profession of the church or law; into one of which I should have been
forced by necessity, had not a friend left me 900<i>l.</i> This bequest was
from a young man with whom, though I call him friend, I had had but
little connection; and the act was done entirely from a confidence on
his part that I had powers and attainments which might be of use to
mankind. This I have mentioned, because it was his due, and I thought
the fact would give you pleasure. Upon the interest of the 900<i>l.</i>,
400<i>l.</i> being laid out in annuity, with 200<i>l.</i> deducted from the
principal, and 100<i>l.</i> a legacy to my sister, and a 100<i>l.</i> more which
the 'Lyrical Ballads' have brought me, my sister and I contrived to live
seven years, nearly eight. Lord Lonsdale. then died, and the present
Lord Lowther paid to my father's estate 8500<i>l.</i> Of this sum I believe
1800<i>l.</i> apiece will come to my sister and myself; at least, would have
come: but 3000<i>l.</i> was lent out to our poor brother,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> I mean taken
from the whole sum, which was about 1200<i>l.</i> more than his share, which
1200<i>l.</i> belonged to my sister and me. This 1200<i>l.</i> we freely lent him;
whether it was insured or no, I do not know; but I dare say it will
prove to be the case; we did not, however, stipulate for its being
insured. But you shall faithfully know all particulars as soon as I have
learned them.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<h3><a name="letter18" id="letter18" ></a>18. <i>Visit to Thelwall</i>.</h3>

<p>'Mr. Coleridge, my sister, and I had been visiting the famous John
Thelwall, who had taken refuge from politics after a trial for high
treason, with a view to bring up his family by the profits of
agriculture, which proved as unfortunate a speculation as that he had
fled from. Coleridge and he had been public lecturers, Coleridge
mingling with his politics theology, from which the other elocutionist
abstained, unless it were for the sake of a sneer. This quondam
community of public employment induced Thelwall to visit Coleridge, at
Nether-Stowey, where he fell in my way. He really was a man of
extraordinary talent, an affectionate husband, and a good father. Though
brought up in the City, on a tailor's board, he was truly sensible of
the beauty of natural objects. I remember once, when Coleridge, he, and
I were seated upon the turf on the brink of the stream, in the most
beautiful part of the most beautiful glen of Alfoxden, Coleridge
exclaimed, "This is a place to reconcile one to all the jarrings and
conflicts of the wide world." "Nay," said Thelwall, "to make one forget
them altogether." The visit of this man to Coleridge was, as I believe
Coleridge has related, the occasion of a spy being sent by Government to
watch our proceedings, which were, I can say with truth, such as the
world at large would have thought ludicrously harmless.'<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>'We left Alfoxden on Monday morning, the 26th of June, stayed with
Coleridge till the Monday following, then set forth on foot towards
Bristol. We were at Cottle's for a week, and thence we went towards the
banks of the Wye. We crossed the Severn Ferry, and walked ten miles
further to Tintern Abbey, a very beautiful ruin on the Wye. The next
morning we walked along the river through Monmouth to Goderich Castle,
there slept, and returned the next day to Tintern, thence to Chepstow,
and from Chepstow back again in a boat to Tintern, where we slept, and
thence back in a small vessel to Bristol.</p>

<p>'The Wye is a stately and majestic river from its width and depth, but
never slow and sluggish; you can always hear its murmur. It travels

<p>'We left Cottle, as you know, at Greta Bridge. We were obliged to take
the mail over Stanemoor: the road interesting with sun and mist. At
Temple Sowerby I learned that John was at Newbiggin. I sent a note; he
came, looks very well, said he would accompany us a few days. Next day
we set off and dined at Mr. Myers', thence to Bampton, where we slept.
On Friday proceeded along the lake of Hawes-Water, a noble scene which
pleased us much. The mists hung so low that we could not go directly
over to Ambleside, so we went round by Long Sleddale to Kentmere,
Troutbeck, Rayrigg, and Bowness;... a rainy and raw day.... Went to the
ferry, much disgusted with the new erections about Windermere;...
thence to Hawkshead: great change among the people since we were last
there. Next day by Rydal to Grasmere, Robert Newton's. At Robert
Newton's we have remained till to-day. John left us on Tuesday: we
walked with him to the tarn. This day was a fine one, and we had some
grand mountain scenery; the rest of the week has been bad weather. The
evening before last we walked to the upper waterfall at Rydal, and saw
it through the gloom, and it was very magnificent. Coleridge was much
struck with Grasmere and its neighbourhood. I have much to say to you.
You will think my plan a mad one, but I have thought of building a house
there by the lake-side. John would give me 40<i>l.</i> to buy the ground.
There is a small house at Grasmere empty, which, perhaps, we may take;

<div class="center">LETTER TO COLERIDGE (1799): JOURNEY FROM SOCKBURN TO GRASMERE.</div>

<p>'We arrived here on the evening of St. Thomas's day, last Friday [1799],
and have now been four days in our new abode without writing to you&mdash;a
long time! but we have been in such confusion as not to have had a
moment's leisure. My dear friend, we talk of you perpetually, and for me
I see you every where. But let me be a little more methodical. We left
Sockburn last Tuesday morning. We crossed the Tees by moon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>{239}</span>light in the
Sockburn fields, and after ten good miles' riding came in sight of the
Swale. It is there a beautiful river, with its green bank and flat holms
scattered over with trees. Four miles further brought us to Richmond,
with its huge ivied castle, its friarage steeple, its castle tower
resembling a huge steeple, and two other steeple towers, for such they
appeared to us. The situation of this place resembles that of Barnard
Castle, but I should suppose is somewhat inferior to it. George
accompanied us eight miles further, and there we parted with sorrowful
hearts. We were now in Wensley Dale, and D[orothy] and I set off side by
side to foot it as far as Kendal. I will not clog my letter with a
description of this celebrated dale; but I must not neglect to mention
that a little before sunset we reached one of the waterfalls, of which I
read you a short description in Mr. Taylor's tour. It is a singular
scene; I meant to have given you some account of it, but I feel myself
too lazy to execute the task. 'Tis such a performance as you might have
expected from some giant gardener employed by one of Queen Elizabeth's
courtiers, if this same giant gardener had consulted with Spenser, and
they two had finished the work together. By this you will understand
that it is at once formal and wild. We reached Askrigg, twelve miles,
before six in the evening, having been obliged to walk the last two
miles over hard frozen roads, to the great annoyance of our ankles and
feet. Next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow, enough to
make the road soft, and prevent its being slippery. On leaving Askrigg,
we turned aside to see another waterfall. It was a beautiful morning,
with driving snow showers, which disappeared by fits, and unveiled the
east, which was all one delicious pale orange colour. After walking
through two small fields we came to a mill, which we passed; and in a
moment a sweet little valley opened before us with an area of grassy
ground, and a stream dashing over various laminae of black rocks close
under a bank covered with firs; the bank and stream on our left, another
woody bank on our right, and the flat meadow in front, from which, as at
Buttermere the stream had retired, as it were, to hide itself under the
shade. As we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look
back perpetually on the stream, which reflected the orange lights of the
morning among the gloomy rocks, with a brightness varying with the
agitation of the current. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>{240}</span> steeple of Askrigg was between us and the
east, at the bottom of the valley; it was not a quarter of a mile
distant, but oh! how far we were from it! The two banks seemed to join
before us with a facing of rock common to them both. When we reached
this bottom the valley opened out again; two rocky banks on each side,
which, hung with ivy and moss, and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood,
ran directly parallel to each other, and then approaching with a gentle
curve at their point of union, presented a lofty waterfall, the
termination of the valley. It was a keen frosty morning, showers of snow
threatening us, but the sun bright and active. We had a task of
twenty-one miles to perform in a short winter's day. All this put our
minds into such a state of excitation, that we were no unworthy
spectators of this delightful scene. On a nearer approach the waters
seemed to fall down a tall arch, or niche, that had shaped itself by
insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle. We left this spot
with reluctance, but highly exhilarated. When we had walked about a mile
and a half, we overtook two men with a string of ponies and some empty
carts. I recommended to Dorothy to avail herself of this opportunity of
husbanding her strength: we rode with them more than two miles. 'Twas
bitter cold, the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a
mountain storm. We soon reached an inn at a place called Hardrane, and
descending from our vehicles, after warming ourselves by the cottage
fire, we walked up the brook-side to take a view of a third waterfall.
We had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky
banks, before we came full upon the waterfall, which seemed to throw
itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock, the water, which shot
manifestly to some distance from the rock, seeming to be dispersed into
a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason. We were
disappointed in the cascade itself, though the introductory and
accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty. We
walked up to the fall; and what would I not give if I could convey to
you the feelings and images which were then communicated to me? After
cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes,
encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall, we found
the rock, which before had appeared like a wall, extending itself over
our heads, like the ceiling of a huge cave, from the summit of which the
waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>{241}</span> shot directly over our heads into a bason, and among fragments
wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow, or rather, as Dorothy
says, like congealed froth. The water fell at least ten yards from us,
and we stood directly behind it, the excavation not so deep in the rock
as to impress any feeling of darkness, but lofty and magnificent; but in
connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as
could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful. The spot
where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which I am now sitting, and
the incumbent rock, of which the groundwork was limestone, veined and
dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible
variety of colour. On the summit of the cave were three festoons, or
rather wrinkles, in the rock, run up parallel like the folds of a
curtain when it is drawn up. Each of these was hung with icicles of
various length, and nearly in the middle of the festoon in the deepest
valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other, the stream shot
from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength, and with a body
of water that varied every moment. Sometimes the stream shot into the
bason in one continued current; sometimes it was interrupted almost in
the midst of its fall, and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no
great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder-shower. In such a
situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky.
Large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water,
and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant. The rocks on
each side, which, joining with the side of this cave, formed the vista
of the brook, were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls, or rather
courses of water. Each of these was a miniature of all that summer and
winter can produce of delicate beauty. The rock in the centre of the
falls, where the water was most abundant, a deep black, the adjoining
parts yellow, white, purple, and dove-colour, covered with water-plants
of the most vivid green, and hung with streaming icicles, that in some
places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants, and the violet and
yellow variegation of the rocks; and in some places render the colours
more brilliant. I cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced
by this Arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great
waterfall behind which we stood, and alternately hid and revealed each
of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession, or displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>{242}</span> them
with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was
thickened or dispersed. What a scene, too, in summer! In the luxury of
our imagination we could not help feeding upon the pleasure which this
cave, in the heat of a July noon, would spread through a frame
exquisitely sensible. That huge rock on the right, the bank winding
round on the left, with all its living foliage, and the breeze stealing
up the valley, and bedewing the cavern with the freshest imaginable
spray. And then the murmur of the water, the quiet, the seclusion, and a
long summer day.'<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

amends for an ordinary mansion. The whole of the Teviot, and the
pastoral steeps about Mosspaul, pleased us exceedingly. The Esk, below
Langholm, is a delicious river, and we saw it to great advantage. We did
not omit noticing Johnnie Armstrong's Keep; but his hanging-place, to
our great regret, we missed. We were, indeed, most truly sorry that we
could not have you along with us into Westmoreland. The country was in
its full glory; the verdure of the valleys, in which we are so much
superior to you in Scotland, but little tarnished by the weather; and
the trees putting on their most beautiful looks. My sister was quite
enchanted; and we often said to each other, "What a pity Mr. Scott is
not with us!..." I had the pleasure of seeing Coleridge and Southey at
Keswick last Sunday. Southey, whom I never saw much of before, I liked
much: he is very pleasant in his manner, and a man of great reading in
old books, poetry, chronicles, memoirs, &amp;c., particularly Spanish and
Portuguese.... My sister and I often talk of the happy days that we
spent in your company. Such things do not occur often in life. If we
live, we shall meet again; that is my consolation when I think of these
things. Scotland and England sound like division, do what we can; but we
really are but neighbours, and if you were no further off, and in
Yorkshire, we should think so. Farewell! God prosper you, and all that
belongs to you! Your sincere friend, for such I will call myself, though
slow to use a word of such solemn meaning to any one,</p>

<h3><a name="letter27" id="letter27" ></a>27. <i>The Grove: Captain John Wordsworth</i>.</h3>

<p>John Wordsworth left Grasmere on Michaelmas-day, 1800, walking over by
Grisedale Tarn to Paterdale, whence he would proceed to Penrith; he took
leave of his brother William, near the Tarn, where Ullswater first comes
in view; and he went to sea again, in the Abergavenny East-Indiaman, in
the spring of 1801.</p>

<p>After his departure from Grasmere, the Poet discovered a track which had
been worn by his brother's steps 'pacing there unwearied and alone,'
during the winter weather, in a sheltering fir-grove above the cottage,
and henceforth <i>that</i> fir-grove was known to the Poet's household by the
name of 'John's Grove,' or 'Brother's Grove.' Of this Wordsworth writes:</p>

<p>'<i>When to the attractions of the busy world</i>,' 1805.&mdash;'The grove still
exists, but the plantation has been walled in, and is not so accessible
as when my brother John wore the path in the manner described. The grove
was a favourite haunt with us all while we lived at Town-End.'<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Captain Wordsworth returned from the voyage on which he sailed in 1801;
and in November 1802, he writes for directions what books to buy to
carry with him on a voyage of sixteen months....</p>

<p>'Tell John' says Wordsworth, 'when he buys Spenser, to purchase an
edition which has his "State of Ireland" in it. This is in prose. This
edition may be scarce, but one surely can be found.</p>

<p>'Milton's Sonnets (transcribe all this for John, as said by me to him) I
think manly and dignified compositions, distinguished by simplicity and
unity of object and aim, and undisfigured by false or vicious ornaments.
They are in several places incorrect, and sometimes uncouth in language,
and, perhaps, in some, inharmonious; yet, upon the whole, I think the
music exceedingly well suited to its end, that is, it has an energetic
and varied flow of sound crowding into narrow room more of the combined
effect of rhyme and blank verse than can be done by any other kind of
verse I know. The Sonnets of Milton which I like best are that to

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">Grasmere, Feb. 11. 1805.</span><br />
<br />
<p>
MY DEAR FRIEND,<br />
</p>

<p>The public papers will already have broken the shock which the sight of
this letter will give you: you will have learned by them the loss of the
Earl of Abergavenny East-Indiaman, and, along with her, of a great
proportion of the crew,&mdash;that of her captain, our brother, and a most
beloved brother he was. This calamitous news we received at 2 o'clock
to-day, and I write to you from a house of mourning. My poor sister, and
my wife who loved him almost as we did (for he was one of the most
amiable of men), are in miserable affliction, which I do all in my power
to alleviate; but Heaven knows I want consolation myself. I can say
nothing higher of my ever-dear brother, than that he was worthy of his
sister, who is now weeping beside me, and of the friendship of
Coleridge; meek, affectionate, silently enthusiastic, loving all quiet
things, and a poet in every thing but words.</p>

<p>Alas! what is human life! This present moment, I thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>{246}</span> this morning,
would have been devoted to the pleasing employment of writing a letter
to amuse you in your confinement. I had singled out several little
fragments (descriptions merely), which I purposed to have transcribed
from my poems, thinking that the perusal of them might give you a few
minutes' gratification; and now I am called to this melancholy office.</p>

<p>I shall never forget your goodness in writing so long and interesting a
letter to me under such circumstances. This letter also arrived by the
same post which brought the unhappy tidings of my brother's death, so
that they were both put into my hands at the same moment....</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Your affectionate friend,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">W. WORDSWORTH.</span><br />
</p>

<p>I shall do all in my power to sustain my sister under her sorrow, which
is, and long will be, bitter and poignant. We did not love him as a
brother merely, but as a man of original mind, and an honour to all
about him. Oh! dear friend, forgive me for talking thus. We have had no
tidings of Coleridge. I tremble for the moment when he is to hear of my
brother's death; it will distress him to the heart,&mdash;and his poor body
cannot bear sorrow. He loved my brother, and he knows how we at Grasmere
loved him.</p>


<p>Nine days afterwards, Wordsworth resumed the subject as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">Grasmere, Feb. 20. 1805.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Having spoken of worldly affairs, let me again mention my beloved
brother. It is now just five years since, after a separation of fourteen
years (I may call it a separation, for we only saw him four or five
times, and by glimpses), he came to visit his sister and me in this
cottage, and passed eight blessed months with us. He was then waiting
for the command of the ship to which he was appointed when he quitted
us. As you will have seen, we had little to live upon, and he as little
(Lord Lonsdale being then alive). But he encouraged me to persist, and
to keep my eye steady on its object. He would work for me (that was his
language), for me and his sister; and I was to endeavour to do something
for the world. He went to sea, as commander, with this hope; his voyage
was very unsuccessful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>{247}</span> he having lost by it considerably. When he came
home, we chanced to be in London, and saw him. 'Oh!' said he, 'I have
thought of you, and nothing but you; if ever of myself, and my bad
success, it was only on your account.' He went again to sea a second
time, and also was unsuccessful; still with the same hopes on our
account, though then not so necessary, Lord Lowther having paid the
money.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Lastly came the lamentable voyage, which he entered upon,
full of expectation, and love to his sister and myself, and my wife,
whom, indeed, he loved with all a brother's tenderness. This is the end
of his part of the agreement&mdash;of his efforts for my welfare! God grant
me life and strength to fulfil mine! I shall never forget him,&mdash;never
lose sight of him: there is a bond between us yet, the same as if he
were living, nay, far more sacred, calling upon me to do my utmost, as
he to the last did his utmost to live in honour and worthiness. Some of
the newspapers carelessly asserted that he did not wish to survive his
ship. This is false. He was heard by one of the surviving officers
giving orders, with all possible calmness, a very little before the ship
went down; and when he could remain at his post no longer, then, and not
till then, he attempted to save himself. I knew this would be so, but it
was satisfactory for me to have it confirmed by external evidence. Do
not think our grief unreasonable. Of all human beings whom I ever knew,
he was the man of the most rational desires, the most sedate habits, and
the most perfect self-command. He was modest and gentle, and shy even to
disease; but this was wearing off. In every thing his judgments were
sound and original; his taste in all the arts, music and poetry in
particular (for these he, of course, had had the best opportunities of
being familiar with), was exquisite; and his eye for the beauties of
nature was as fine and delicate as ever poet or painter was gifted with,
in some discriminations, owing to his education and way of life, far
superior to any person's I ever knew. But, alas! what avails it? It was
the will of God that he should be taken away.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I trust in God that I shall not want fortitude; but my loss is great and
irreparable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>{248}</span></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Many thanks for the offer of your house; but I am not likely to be
called to town. Lady Beaumont gives us hope we may see you next summer:
this would, indeed, be great joy to us all. My sister thanks Lady B. for
her affectionate remembrance of her and her letter, and will write as
soon as ever she feels herself able. Her health, as was to be expected,
has suffered much.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Your most affectionate friend,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">W. WORDSWORTH.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Again:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">Grasmere, March 12. 1805.</span><br />
</p>

<p>As I have said, your last letter affected me much. A thousand times have
I asked myself, as your tender sympathy led me to do, 'why was he taken
away?' and I have answered the question as you have done. In fact, there
is no other answer which can satisfy and lay the mind at rest. Why have
we a choice, and a will, and a notion of justice and injustice, enabling
us to be moral agents? Why have we sympathies that make the best of us
so afraid of inflicting pain and sorrow, which yet we see dealt about so
lavishly by the Supreme Governor? Why should our notions of right
towards each other, and to all sentient beings within our influence,
differ so widely from what appears to be His notion and rule, <i>if every
thing were to end here</i>? Would it not be blasphemy to say that, upon the
supposition of the thinking principle being <i>destroyed by death</i>,
however inferior we may be to the great Cause and Ruler of things, we
have <i>more of love</i> in our nature than He has? The thought is monstrous;
and yet how to get rid of it, except upon the supposition of <i>another</i>
and a <i>better world</i>, I do not see. As to my departed brother, who leads
our minds at present to these reflections, he walked all his life pure
among many impure. Except a little hastiness of temper, when any thing
was done in a clumsy or bungling manner, or when improperly contradicted
upon occasions of not much importance, he had not one vice of his
profession. I never heard an oath, or even an indelicate expression or
allusion, from him in my life; his modesty was equal to that of the
purest woman. In prudence, in meekness, in self-denial, in fortitude, in
just desires and elegant and refined enjoyments, with an entire
simplicity of manners, life, and habit, he was all<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>{249}</span> that could be wished
for in man; strong in health, and of a noble person, with every hope
about him that could render life dear, thinking of, and living only for,
others,&mdash;and we see what has been his end! So good must be better; so
high must be destined to be higher.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I will take this opportunity of saying, that the newspaper accounts of
the loss of the ship are throughout grossly inaccurate. The chief facts
I will state, in a few words, from the deposition at the India House of
one of the surviving officers. She struck at 5 P.M. Guns were fired
immediately, and were continued to be fired. She was gotten off the rock
at half-past seven, but had taken in so much water, in spite of constant
pumping, as to be water-logged. They had, however, hope that she might
still be run upon Weymouth Sands, and with this view continued pumping
and baling till eleven, when she went down. The longboat could not be
hoisted out, as, had that been done, there would have been no
possibility of the ship being run aground. I have mentioned these
things, because the newspaper accounts were such as tended to throw
discredit on my brother's conduct and personal firmness, stating that
the ship had struck an hour and a half before guns were fired, and that,
in the agony of the moment, the boats had been forgotten to be hoisted
out. We knew well this could not be; but, for the sake of the relatives
of the persons lost, it distressed us much that it should have been
said. A few minutes before the ship went down, my brother was seen
talking with the first mate, with apparent cheerfulness; and he was
standing on the hen-coop, which is the point from which he could
overlook the whole ship, the moment she went down, dying, as he had
lived, in the very place and point where his duty stationed him. I must
beg your pardon for detaining you so long on this melancholy subject;
and yet it is not altogether melancholy, for what nobler spectacle can
be contemplated than that of a virtuous man, with a serene countenance,
in such an overwhelming situation? I will here transcribe a passage
which I met with the other day in a review; it is from Aristotle's
'Synopsis of the Virtues and Vices.'<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> 'It is,' says he, 'the property
of fortitude not to be easily terrified by the dread of things
pertaining to death; to possess good confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>{250}</span> in things terrible, and
presence of mind in dangers; rather to prefer to be put to death
worthily, than to be preserved basely; and to be the cause of victory.
Moreover, it is the property of fortitude to labour and endure, and to
make valorous exertion an object of choice. Further, presence of mind, a
well-disposed soul, confidence and boldness are the attendants on
fortitude; and, besides these, industry and patience.' Except in the
circumstance of making valorous exertion an 'object <i>of choice</i>' (if the
philosopher alludes to general habits of character), my brother might
have sat for this picture; but he was of a meek and retired nature,
loving all quiet things.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">I remain, dear Sir George,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Your most affectionate friend,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">W. WORDSWORTH.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The following, to his friend Southey, was written the morrow after the
arrival of the sad tidings:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Tuesday Evening, Grasmere, 1805.</span><br />
</p>

<p>We see nothing here that does not remind us of our dear brother; there
is nothing about us (save the children, whom he had not seen) that he
has not known and loved.</p>

<p>If you could bear to come to this house of mourning to-morrow, I should
be for ever thankful. We weep much to-day, and that relieves us. As to
fortitude, I hope I shall show that, and that all of us will show it in
a proper time, in keeping down many a silent pang hereafter. But grief
will, as you say, and must, have its course; there is no wisdom in
attempting to check it under the circumstances which we are all of us in
here.</p>

<p>I condole with you, from my soul, on the melancholy account of your own
brother's situation; God grant you may not hear such tidings! Oh! it
makes the heart groan, that, with such a beautiful world as this to live
in, and such a soul as that of man's is by nature and gift of God, that
we should go about on such errands as we do, destroying and laying
waste; and ninety-nine of us in a hundred never easy in any road that
travels towards peace and quietness. And yet, what virtue and what
goodness, what heroism and courage, what triumphs of disinterested love
everywhere, and human life, after all, what is it! Surely, this is not
to be for ever, even on this perishable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>{251}</span> planet! Come to us to-morrow,
if you can; your conversation, I know, will do me good.</p>

<p>All send best remembrances to you all.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Your affectionate friend,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">W. WORDSWORTH.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The following, to another friend, completes the sad tale:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">Grasmere, March 16. 1805.</span><br />
</p>

<p>He wrote to us from Portsmouth, about twelve days before this disaster,
full of hopes, saying that he was to sail to-morrow. Of course, at the
time when we heard this deplorable news, we imagined that he was as far
on his voyage as Madeira. It was, indeed, a thunderstroke to us! The
language which he held was always so encouraging, saying that ships
were, in nine instances out of ten, lost by mismanagement: he had,
indeed, a great fear of pilots, and I have often heard him say, that no
situation could be imagined more distressing than that of being at the
mercy of these men. 'Oh!' said he, 'it is a joyful hour for us when we
get rid of them.' His fears, alas! were too well founded; his own ship
was lost while under the management of the pilot, whether mismanaged by
him or not, I do not know; but know for certain, which is, indeed, our
great consolation, that our dear brother did all that man could do, even
to the sacrifice of his own life. The newspaper accounts were grossly
inaccurate; indeed, that must have been obvious to any person who could
bear to think upon the subject, for they were absolutely unintelligible.
There are two pamphlets upon the subject; one a mere transcript from the
papers; the other may be considered, as to all important particulars, as
of authority; it is by a person high in the India House, and contains
the deposition of the surviving officers concerning the loss of the
ship. The pamphlet, I am told, is most unfeelingly written: I have only
seen an extract from it, containing Gilpin's deposition, the fourth
mate. From this, it appears that every thing was done that could be
done, under the circumstances, for the safety of the lives and the ship.
My poor brother was standing on the hen-coop (which is placed upon the
poop, and is the most commanding situation in the vessel) when she went
down, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>{252}</span> thence washed overboard by a large sea, which sank the
ship. He was seen struggling with the waves some time afterwards, having
laid hold, it is said, of a rope. He was an excellent swimmer; but what
could it avail in such a sea, encumbered with his clothes, and exhausted
in body, as he must have been!</p>

<p>For myself, I feel that there is something cut out of my life which
cannot be restored. I never thought of him but with hope and delight: we
looked forward to the time, not distant, as we thought, when he would
settle near us, when the task of his life would be over, and he would
have nothing to do but reap his reward. By that time, I hoped also that
the chief part of my labours would be executed, and that I should be
able to show him that he had not placed a false confidence in me. I
never wrote a line without a thought of its giving him pleasure: my
writings, printed and manuscript, were his delight, and one of the chief
solaces of his long voyages. But let me stop: I will not be cast down;
were it only for his sake, I will not be dejected. I have much yet to
do, and pray God to give me strength and power: his part of the
agreement between us is brought to an end, mine continues; and I hope
when I shall be able to think of him with a calmer mind, that the
remembrance of him dead will even animate me more than the joy which I
had in him living. I wish you would procure the pamphlet I have
mentioned; you may know the right one, by its having a motto from
Shakspeare, from Clarence's dream. I wish you to see it, that you may
read G.'s statement, and be enabled, if the affair should ever be
mentioned in your hearing, to correct the errors which they must have
fallen into who have taken their ideas from the newspaper accounts. I
have dwelt long, too long I fear, upon this subject, but I could not
write to you upon any thing else, till I had unburthened my heart. We
have great consolations from the sources you allude to; but, alas! we
have much yet to endure. Time only can give us regular tranquillity. We
neither murmur nor repine, but sorrow we must; we should be senseless
else.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>{253}</span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Paterdale, Nov. 7. 1803.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SCOTT,<br />
</p>

<p>I was much pleased to hear of your engagement with Dryden: not that he
is, as a poet, any great favourite of mine. I admire his talents and
genius highly, but his is not a poetical genius. The only qualities I
can find in Dryden that are <i>essentially</i> poetical, are a certain ardour
and impetuosity of mind, with an excellent ear. It may seem strange that
I do not add to this, great command of language. <i>That</i> he certainly
has, and of such language too, as it is most desirable that a poet
should possess, or rather, that he should not be without. But it is not
language that is, in the highest sense of the word, poetical, being
neither of the imagination nor of the passions; I mean the amiable, the
ennobling, or the intense passions. I do not mean to say that there is
nothing of this in Dryden, but as little, I think, as is possible,
considering how much he has written. You will easily understand my
meaning, when I refer to his versification of 'Palamon and Arcite,' as
contrasted with the language of Chaucer. Dryden had neither a tender
heart nor a lofty sense of moral dignity. Whenever his language is
poetically impassioned, it is mostly upon unpleasing subjects, such as
the follies, vices, and crimes of classes of men, or of individuals.
That his cannot be the language of imagination, must have necessarily
followed from this,&mdash;that there is not a single image from Nature in the
whole body of his works; and in his translation from Virgil, whenever
Virgil can be fairly said to have his <i>eye</i> upon his object, Dryden
always spoils the passage.</p>

<p>But too much of this; I am glad that you are to be his editor. His
political and satirical pieces may be greatly benefited by illustration,
and even absolutely require it. A correct text is the first object of an
editor; then such notes as explain difficult or obscure passages; and
lastly, which is much less important, notes pointing out authors to whom
the Poet has been indebted, not in the fiddling way of phrase here and
phrase<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>{254}</span> there (which is detestable as a general practice), but where he
has had essential obligations either as to matter or manner.</p>

<p>If I can be of any use to you, do not fail to apply to me. One thing I
may take the liberty to suggest, which is, when you come to the fables,
might it not be advisable to print the whole of the Tales of Boccace in
a smaller type in the original language? If this should look too much
like swelling a book, I should certainly make such extracts as would
show where Dryden has most strikingly improved upon, or fallen below,
his original. I think his translations from Boccace are the best, at
least the most poetical, of his poems. It is many years since I saw
Boccace, but I remember that Sigismunda is not married by him to
Guiscard (the names are different in Boccace in both tales, I believe,
certainly in Theodore, &amp;c.). I think Dryden has much injured the story
by the marriage, and degraded Sigismunda's character by it. He has also,
to the best of my remembrance, degraded her still more, by making her
love absolute sensuality and appetite; Dryden had no other notion of the
passion. With all these defects, and they are very gross ones, it is a
noble poem. Guiscard's answer, when first reproached by Tancred, is
noble in Boccace, nothing but this: <i>Amor pu&agrave; molto pi&ugrave; che ne roi ne io
possiamo</i>. This, Dryden has spoiled. He says first very well, 'The
faults of love by love are justified,' and then come four lines of
miserable rant, quite <i>&agrave; la Maximin</i>. Farewell, and believe me ever,</p>

<h3><a name="letter31" id="letter31" ></a>31. <i>Of Marmion</i>.</h3>

<div class="center">EXTRACT OF LETTER TO SIR WALTER SCOTT (1808).</div>

<p>Thank you for 'Marmion.' I think your end has been attained. That it is
not the end which I should wish you to propose to yourself, you will be
well aware, from what you know of my notions of composition, both as to
matter and manner. In the circle of my acquaintance it seems as well
liked as the 'Lay,' though I have heard that in the world it is not so.

<br />
MY DEAR WRANGHAM,<br />
</p>

<p>In what are you employed&mdash;I mean by way of amusement and relaxation from
your professional duties? Is there any topographical history of your
neighbourhood? I remember reading White's <i>Natural History and
Antiquities of Selbourne</i> with great pleasure, when a boy at school, and
I have lately read Dr. Whitaker's <i>History of Craven and Whalley</i>, both
with profit and pleasure. Would it not be worth your while to give some
of your leisure hours to a work of this kind, making those works partly
your model, and adding thereto from the originality of your own mind?</p>

<p>With your activity you might produce something of this kind of general
interest, taking for your limit any division in your neighbourhood,
natural, ecclesiastical, or civil: suppose, for example, the coast from
the borders of Cleveland, or from Scarborough, to Spurnhead; and inward
into the country to any boundary that you might approve of. Pray think
of this. I am induced to mention it from belief that you are admirably
qualified for such a work; that it would pleasantly employ your leisure
hours; and from a regret in seeing works of this kind, which might be
made so very interesting, utterly marred by falling into the hands of
wretched bunglers, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>History of Cleveland</i>, which I have just
read, by a Clergyman of &mdash;&mdash;, the most heavy performance I ever
encountered; and what an interesting district! Pray let me hear from you
soon.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 28em;">Grasmere, Dec. 3. 1808.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR WRANGHAM,<br />
</p>

<p>On the other side you have the prospectus of a weekly essay intended to
be published by your friend Coleridge.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Your Sermon did not reach me till the night before last; we have all
read it, and are much pleased with it. Upon the whole, I like it better
than the last: it must have been heard with great interest. I differ,
however, from you in a few particulars. 1st. The Spaniards 'devoting
themselves for an imprisoned Bourbon, or the crumbling relics of the
Inquisition.' This is very fair for pointing a sentence, but it is not
the truth. They have told us over and over again, that they are
<i>fighting against a foreign tyrant</i>, who has dealt with them most
perfidiously and inhumanly, who must hate them for their worth, and on
account of the injuries they have received from him, and whom they must
hate accordingly; <i>against</i> a ruler over whom they could have no
control, and <i>for</i> one whom they have told us they will establish as a
sovereign of a <i>free</i> people, and therefore must he himself be a limited
monarch. You will permit me to make to you this representation for its
truth's sake, and because it gives me an opportunity of letting out a
secret, viz. that I myself am very deep in this subject, and about to
publish upon it, first, I believe, in a newspaper, for the sake of
immediate and wide circulation; and next, the same matter in a separate
pamphlet, under the title of 'The Convention of Cintra brought to the
test of principles, and the people of Great Britain vindicated from the
charge of having prejudged it.' You will wonder to hear me talk of
principles when I have told you that I also do not go along with you in
your sentiments respecting the Roman Catholic question. I confess I am
not prepared to see the Roman Catholic religion as the Established
Church of Ireland; and how that can be consistently refused to them, if
other things are granted on the plea of their being the majority, I do
not see. Certainly this demand will follow, and how would it be
answered?</p>

<p>There is yet another circumstance in which I differ from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>{257}</span> you. If Dr.
Bell's plan of education be of that importance which it appears to be
of, it cannot be a matter of indifference whether he or Lancaster have a
rightful claim to the invention. For Heaven's sake let all benefactors
of their species have the honour due to them. Virgil gives a high place
in Elysium to the improvers of life, and it is neither the least
philosophical or least poetical passage of the <i>Aeneid</i>.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> These
points of difference being stated, I may say that in other things I
greatly approve both of the matter and manner of your Sermon.</p>

<p>Do not fail to return my best thanks to the lady to whom I am obliged
for the elegant and accurate drawing of Broughton Church. I should have
written to thank her and you for it immediately, but I foresaw that I
should have occasion to write to you on this or other business.</p>

<p>All here desire their best remembrances; and believe me (in great haste,
for I have several other letters to write on the same subject),
affectionately yours,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 28em;">Workington, April 8. 1809.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR WRANGHAM,<br />
</p>

<p>You will think I am afraid that I have used you ill in not replying
sooner to your last letter; particularly as you were desirous to be
informed in what newspaper my Pamphlet was printing. I should not have
failed to give you immediately any information upon this subject which
could be of use; but in fact, though I began to publish in a newspaper,
viz. the '<i>Courier</i>, an accidental loss of two or three sheets of the
manuscript prevented me from going on in that mode of publication after
two sections had appeared. The Pamphlet will be out in less than a
fortnight, entitled, at full length, 'Concerning the relations of Great
Britain, Spain, and Portugal, to each other, and to the common enemy at
this crisis, and specifically as affected by the Convention of Cintra;
the whole brought to the test of those principles by which alone the
independence and freedom of nations can be preserved or recovered.' This
is less<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>{258}</span> a Title than a Table of Contents. I give it you at full length
in order that you may set your fancy at work (if you have no better
employment for it) upon what the Pamphlet may contain. I sent off the
last sheets only a day or two since, else I should have written to you
sooner; it having been my intention to pay my debt to you the moment I
had discharged this debt to my country. What I have written has been
done according to the best light of my conscience: it is indeed very
imperfect, and will, I fear, be little read; but if it is read, cannot,
I hope, fail of doing some good; though I am aware it will create me a
world of enemies, and call forth the old yell of Jacobinism. I have not
sent it to any personal friends as such, therefore I have made no
exception in your case. I have ordered it to be sent to two, the Spanish
and Portuguese Ambassadors, and three or four other public men and
Members of Parliament, but to nobody of my friends and relations. It is
printed with my name, and, I believe, will be published by Longman.... I
am very happy that you have not been inattentive to my suggestion on the
subject of Topography. When I ventured to recommend the pursuit to you,
I did not for a moment suppose that it was to interfere with your
appropriate duties as a parish priest; far otherwise: but I know you are
of an active mind, and I am sure that a portion of your time might be
thus employed without any deduction from that which was due to your
professional engagements. It would be a recreation to you; and also it
does appear to me that records of this kind ought to be executed by
somebody or other, both for the instruction of those now living and for
the sake of posterity; and if so, the duty devolves more naturally upon
clergymen than upon other persons, as their opportunities and
qualifications are both likely to be better than those of other men. If
you have not seen White's and Whitaker's books do procure a sight of
them.</p>

<p>I was aware that you would think me fair game upon the Roman Catholic
question; but really I should be greatly obliged to any man who would
help me over the difficulty I stated. If the Roman Catholics, upon the
plea of their being the majority merely (which implies an admission on
our part that their profession of faith is in itself as good as ours, as
consistent with civil liberty), if they are to have their requests
accorded, how can they be refused (consistently) the further prayer of
being<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>{259}</span> constituted, upon the same plea, the Established Church? I
confess I am not prepared for this. With the Methodists on one side and
the Catholics on the other, what is to become of the poor church and the
people of England? to both of which I am most tenderly attached, and to
the former not the less so, on account of the pretty little spire of
Broughton Parish Church, under which you and I were made happy men by
the gift from Providence of two excellent wives. To Mrs. Wrangham,
present my cordial regards, and believe me, dear Wrangham, your very</p>

<p>I had also another reason for deferring this acknowledgment to your

was finished, and ought to have appeared, two months ago, but has been
delayed by circumstances (connected with my distance from the press)
over which I had no control. If this Tract should so far interest your
Lordship as to induce you to peruse it, I do not doubt that it will be
thoughtfully and candidly judged by you; in which case I fear no
censure, but that which every man is liable to who, with good
intentions, may have occasionally fallen into error; while at the same
time I have an entire confidence that the principles which I have
endeavoured to uphold must have the sanction of a mind distinguished,

<p>MY DEAR SOUTHEY,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Col. Campbell, our neighbour at G., has sent for your book; he served
during the whole of the Peninsular war, and you shall hear what he says
of it in <i>due course</i>. We are out of the way of all literary
communication, so I can report nothing. I have read the whole with great
pleasure; the work will do you everlasting honour. I have said <i>the
whole</i>, forgetting, in that contemplation, my feelings upon one part,
where you have tickled with a feather when you should have branded with
a red-hot iron. You will guess I mean the Convention of Cintra. My
detestation, I may say abhorrence, of that event is not at all
diminished by your account of it. Buonaparte had committed a capital
blunder in supposing that when he had <i>intimidated</i> the <i>Sovereigns</i> of
Europe he had <i>conquered</i> the several <i>Nations</i>. Yet it was natural for
a wiser than he was to have fallen into this mistake; for the old
despotisms had deprived the body of the people of all practical
knowledge in the management, and, of necessity, of all interest, in the
course of affairs. The French themselves were astonished at the apathy
and ignorance of the people whom they had supposed they had utterly
subdued, when they had taken their fortresses, scattered their armies,
entered their capital cities, and struck their cabinets with dismay.
There was no hope for the deliverance of Europe till the nations had
suffered enough to be driven to a passionate recollection of all that
was honourable in their past history, and to make appeal to the
principles of universal and everlasting justice. These sentiments, the
authors of that Convention most unfeelingly violated; and as to the
principles, they seemed to be as little aware even of the existence of
such powers, for powers emphatically may they be called, as the tyrant
himself. As far, therefore, as these men could, they put an extinguisher
upon the star which was then rising. It is in vain to say that after the
first burst of indignation was over, the Portuguese themselves were
reconciled to the event, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>{261}</span> rejoiced in their deliverance. We may
infer from that the horror which they must have felt in the presence of
their oppressors; and we may see in it to what a state of helplessness
their bad government had reduced them. Our duty was to have treated them
with respect as the representatives of suffering humanity beyond what
they were likely to look for themselves, and as deserving greatly, in
common with their Spanish brethren, for having been the first to rise
against the tremendous oppression, and to show how, and how only, it
could be put an end to.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Lowther Castle, Sunday Mor[ning] [Sept. 26, 1830].</span>
</p>
<br />

<p>MY DEAR MR. HAMILTON,</p>

<p>I profit by the frank in which the letter for your sister will be
enclosed, to thank you for yours of the 11th, and the accompanying
spirited and elegant verses. You ask many questions, kindly testifying
thereby the interest you take in us and our neighbourhood. Most probably
some of them are answered in my daughter's letter to Miss E.H. I will,
however, myself reply to one or two at the risk of repeating what she
may have said. 1st. Mrs. Hemans has not sent us any tidings of her
movements and intentions since she left us; so I am unable to tell you
whether she mean to settle in Edinburgh or London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>{262}</span>She said she would write as soon as she could procure a frank. That
accommodation is, I suppose, more rare in Scotland than at this season
in our neighbourhood. I assure you the weather has been so unfavourable
to out-door amusements since you left us (not but that we have had a
sprinkling of fine and bright days), that little or no progress has been
made in the game of the Graces; and I fear that amusement must be
deferred till next summer, if we or anybody else are to see another. Mr.
Barber has dined with us once, and my sister and Mrs. Marshall, of
Halsteads, have seen his palace and grounds; but I cannot report upon
the general state of his temper. I believe he continues to be enchanted,
as far as decayed health will allow, with a Mr. Cooper, a clergyman who
has just come to the living of Hawkshend (about five miles from
Ambleside). Did I tell you that Professor Wilson, with his two sons and
daughter, have been, and probably still are, at Elleray? He heads the
gaieties of the neighbourhood, and has presided as steward at two
regattas. Do these employments come under your notions of action opposed
to contemplation? Why should they not? Whatever the high moralists may
say, the political economists will, I conclude, approve them as setting
capital afloat, and giving an impulse to manufacture and handicrafts;
but I speak of the improvement which may come thence to navigation and
nautical science. I have dined twice along with my brother (who left us
some time ago) in the Professor's company&mdash;at Mrs. Watson's, widow of
the Bp., at Calgarth, and at Mr. Bolton's. Poor Mr. B.! he must have
been greatly shocked at the fatal accident that put an end to his friend
Huskisson's earthly career. There is another acquaintance of mine also
recently gone&mdash;a person for whom I never had any love, but with whom I
had for a short time a good deal of intimacy. I mean Hazlitt, whose
death you may have seen announced in the papers. He was a man of
extraordinary acuteness, but perverse as Lord Byron himself; whose life
by Galt I have been skimming since I came here. Galt affects to be very
profound, though [he] is in fact a very shallow fellow,&mdash;and perhaps the
most illogical writer that these illogical days have produced. His
'buts' and his 'therefores' are singularly misapplied, singularly even
for this unthinking age. He accuses Mr. Southey of pursuing Lord B&mdash;&mdash;
with <i>rancour</i>. I should like a reference to what Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; has written
of Lord B&mdash;&mdash;,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>{263}</span> to ascertain whether this charge be well founded. I
trust it is not, both from what I know of my friend, and for the
aversion which Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; has expressed towards the Lakers, whom in the
plenitude of his ignorance he is pleased to speak of as a <i>class</i> or
<i>school</i> of Poets.</p>

<p>Now for a word on the serious part of your letter. Your views of action
and contemplation are, I think, just. If you can lay your hands upon Mr.
Coleridge's 'Friend,' you will find some remarks of mine upon a letter
signed, if I recollect right, 'Mathetes,' which was written by Professor
Wilson, in which, if I am not mistaken, sentiments like yours are
expressed. At all events, I am sure that I have long retained those
opinions, and have frequently expressed them either by letter or
otherwise. One thing, however, is not to be forgotten concerning active
life&mdash;that a personal independence must be provided for; and in some
cases more is required&mdash;ability to assist our friends, relations, and
natural dependents. The party are at breakfast, and I must close this
wretched scrawl, which pray excuse.</p>

to thank you for your obliging present, which I shall value on every

MY DEAR WRANGHAM,<br />
</p>

<p>Your last letter, which I have left so long unanswered, found me in a
distressed state of mind, with one of my children lying nearly, as I
thought, at the point of death. This put me off answering your
letter....</p>

<p>You return to the R. Catholic Question. I am decidedly of opinion that
no further concessions should be made. The R. Catholic Emancipation is a
mere pretext of ambitious and discontented men. Are you prepared for the
next step&mdash;a R. Catholic Established Church? I confess I dread the
thought.</p>

<p>As to the Bible Society, my view of the subject is as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>{264}</span>follows:&mdash;1st.
Distributing Bibles is a good thing. 2ndly. More Bibles will be
distributed in consequence of the existence of the Bible Society;
therefore, so far as that goes, the existence of the Bible Society is
good. But, 3rdly, as to the <i>indirect</i> benefits expected from it, as
producing a golden age of unanimity among Christians, all that I think
fume and emptiness; nay, far worse. So deeply am I persuaded that
discord and artifice, and pride and ambition, would be fostered by such
an approximation and unnatural alliance of sects, that I am inclined to
think the evil thus produced would more than outweigh the good done by
dispersing the Bibles. I think the last fifty or sixty pages of my
brother's pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> merit the serious consideration of all persons of
the Established Church who have connected themselves with the sectaries
for this purpose....</p>

<p>Entreating your pardon for my long delay in answering your letter, let
me conclude with assuring you that I remain, with great truth, your
affectionate friend,</p>

MY DEAR WRANGHAM,<br />
</p>

<p>Your letter arrived when I was on the point of going from home on
business. I took it with me, intending to answer it upon the road, but I
had not courage to undertake the office on account of the inquiries it
contains concerning my family. I will be brief on this melancholy
subject. In the course of the last year I have lost two sweet children,
a girl and a boy, at the ages of four and six and a half. These
innocents were the delight of our hearts, and beloved by everybody that
knew them. They were cut off in a few hours&mdash;one by the measles, and the
other by convulsions; dying, one half a year after the other. I quit
this sorrowful subject, secure of your sympathy as a father and as my
friend.</p>

<p>My employment I find salutary to me, and of consequence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>{265}</span> a pecuniary
point of view, as my literary employments bring me no remuneration, nor
promise any. As to what you say about the Ministry, I very much prefer
the course of their policy to that of the Opposition; especially on two
points most near my heart: resistance of Buonaparte by force of arms,
and their adherence to the principles of the British Constitution in
withholding political power from the Roman Catholics. My most determined
hostility shall always be directed against those statesmen who, like
Whitbread, Grenville, and others, would crouch to a sanguinary tyrant;
and I cannot act with those who see no danger to the Constitution in
introducing papists into Parliament. There are other points of policy in
which I deem the Opposition grievously mistaken, and therefore I am at
present, and long have been, by principle, a supporter of ministers, as
far as my little influence extends. With affectionate wishes for your
welfare and that of your family, and with best regards to Mrs. Wrangham,
I am, my dear friend,</p>

the name of Jameson, who is just gone from this neighbourhood to a
curacy at Sherbourne, in the neighbourhood of Ferry Bridge. He has a

he is a proficient.... Now my wish is that, if it fall in your way, you

<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>Edith thanked you, in my name, for your valuable present of the
'Peninsular War.' I have read it with great delight: it is beautifully
written, and a most interesting story. I did not notice a single
sentiment or opinion that I could have wished away but one&mdash;where you
support the notion that, if the Duke of Wellington had not lived and
commanded, Buonaparte must have continued the master of Europe. I do not
object to this from any dislike I have to the Duke, but from a
conviction&mdash;I trust, a philosophic one&mdash;that Providence would not allow
the upsetting of so diabolical a system as Buonaparte's to depend upon
the existence of any individual. Justly was it observed by Lord
Wellesley, that Buonaparte was of an order of minds that created for
themselves great reverses. He might have gone further, and said that it
is of the nature of tyranny to work to its own destruction.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>


<p>The sentence of yours which occasioned these loose remarks is, as I
said, the only one I objected to, while I met with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>{267}</span> thousand things to
admire. Your sympathy with the great cause is every where energetically
and feelingly expressed. What fine fellows were Alvarez and Albuquerque;
and how deeply interesting the siege of Gerona!</p>

<p>I have not yet mentioned dear Sir George Beaumont.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> His illness was
not long; and he was prepared by habitually thinking on his latter end.
But it is impossible not to grieve for ourselves, for his loss cannot be
supplied. Let dear Edith stay as long as you can; and when she must go,
pray come for her, and stay a few days with us. Farewell.</p>

<p>Mr. Southey means to present me (as usual) his 'Colloquies,' &amp;c. There
is, perhaps, not a page of them that he did not read me in MS.; and
several of the Dialogues are upon subjects which we have often
discussed. I am greatly interested with much of the book; but upon its
effect as a whole I can yet form no opinion, as it was read to me as it
happened to be written. I need scarcely say that Mr. Southey ranks very
highly, in my opinion, as a prose writer. His style is eminently clear,
lively, and unencumbered, and his information unbounded; and there is a
moral ardour about his compositions which nobly distinguishes them from
the trading and factious authorship of the present day. He may not
improbably be our companion in Wales next year. At the end of this month
he goes, with his family, to the Isle of Man for sea-air; and said, if I
would accompany him, and put off the Welsh tour for another year, he
would join our party. Notwithstanding the inducement, I could not bring
myself to consent; but as things now are, I shall remind him of the hope
he held out.</p>

<h3><a name="letter44" id="letter44" ></a>44. <i>Of alleged Changes in Political Opinions</i>.</h3>

<div class="center">LETTER TO A FRIEND, 1821.</div>

<p>In the year 1821 (October 7) an old friend of Wordsworth thus writes to
him: 'They tell me you have changed your opinions upon many subjects
respecting which we used to think alike; but I am persuaded we shall
neither of us change those great principles which ought to guide us in
our conduct, and lead us to do all the good we can to others. And I am
much mistaken if we should not find many things to talk about without
disturbing ourselves with political or party disputes.'</p>

<p>To this Wordsworth answered as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Dec. 4. 1821.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR L&mdash;&mdash;,<br />
</p>

<p>Your letter ought to have been much earlier acknowledged, and would have
been so, had I not been sure you would ascribe my silence to its true
cause, viz. procrastination, and not to indifference to your kind
attention. There was another feeling which both urged and indisposed me
to write to you,&mdash;I mean the allusion which, in so friendly a manner,
you make to a supposed change in my political opinions. To the
scribblers in pamphlets and periodical publications who have heaped so
much obloquy upon myself and my friends Coleridge and Southey, I have
not condescended to reply, nor ever shall; but to you, my candid and
enlightened friend, I will say a few words on this subject, which, if we
have the good fortune to meet again, as I hope we may, will probably be
further dwelt upon.</p>

<p>I should think that I had lived to little purpose if my notions on the
subject of government had undergone no modification: my youth must, in
that case, have been without enthusiasm, and my manhood endued with
small capability of profiting by reflection. If I were addressing those
who have dealt so liberally with the words renegade, apostate, &amp;c., I
should retort the charge upon them, and say, <i>you</i> have been deluded by
<i>places</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>{269}</span> and <i>persons</i>, while I have stuck to <i>principles</i>. <i>I</i>
abandoned France and her rulers when <i>they</i> abandoned the struggle for
liberty, gave themselves up to tyranny, and endeavoured to enslave the
world. I disapproved of the war against France at its commencement,
thinking, which was, perhaps, an error, that it might have been avoided;
but after Buonaparte had violated the independence of Switzerland, my
heart turned against him, and against the nation that could submit to be
the instrument of such an outrage. Here it was that I parted, in
feeling, from the Whigs, and to a certain degree united with their
adversaries, who were free from the delusion (such I must ever regard
it) of Mr. Fox and his party, that a safe and honourable peace was
practicable with the French nation, and that an ambitious conqueror like
Buonaparte could be softened down into a commercial rival.</p>

<p>In a determination, therefore, to aim at the overthrow of that
inordinate ambition by war, I sided with the ministry, not from general
approbation of their conduct, but as men who thought right on this
essential point. How deeply this question interested me will be plain to
any one who will take the trouble of reading my political sonnets, and
the tract occasioned by the 'Convention of Cintra,' in which are
sufficient evidences of my dissatisfaction with the mode of conducting
the war, and a prophetic display of the course which it would take if
carried on upon the principles of justice, and with due respect for the
feelings of the oppressed nations.</p>

<p>This is enough for foreign politics, as influencing my attachments.</p>

<p>There are three great domestic questions, viz. the liberty of the press,
parliamentary reform, and Roman Catholic concession, which, if I briefly
advert to, no more need be said at present.</p>

<p>A free discussion of public measures through the press I deem the <i>only</i>
safeguard of liberty: without it I have neither confidence in kings,
parliaments, judges, or divines: they have all in their turn betrayed
their country. But the press, so potent for good, is scarcely less so
for evil; and unfortunately they who are misled and abused by its means
are the persons whom it can least benefit. It is the fatal
characteristic of their disease to reject all remedies coming from the
quarter that has caused or aggravated the malady. I am <i>therefore</i> for
vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>{270}</span> restrictions; but there is scarcely any abuse that I would not
endure rather than sacrifice, or even endanger, this freedom.</p>

<p>When I was young (giving myself credit for qualities which I did not
possess, and measuring mankind by that standard) I thought it derogatory
to human nature to set up property in preference to person as a title
for legislative power. That notion has vanished. I now perceive many
advantages in our present complex system of representation which
formerly eluded my observation; this has tempered my ardour for reform:
but if any plan could be contrived for throwing the representation
fairly into the hands of the property of the country, and not leaving it
so much in the hands of the large proprietors as it now is, it should
have my best support; though even in that event there would be a
sacrifice of personal rights, independent of property, that are now
frequently exercised for the benefit of the community.</p>

<p>Be not startled when I say that I am averse to further concessions to
the Roman Catholics. My reasons are, that such concessions will not
produce harmony among the Roman Catholics themselves; that they among
them who are most clamorous for the measure care little about it but as
a step, first, to the overthrow of the Protestant establishment in
Ireland, as introductory to a separation of the two countries&mdash;their
ultimate aim; that I cannot consent to take the character of a religion
from the declaration of powerful professors of it disclaiming doctrines
imputed to that religion; that, taking its character from what it
<i>actually teaches to the great mass</i>, I believe the Roman Catholic
religion to be unchanged in its doctrines and unsoftened in its
spirit,&mdash;how can it be otherwise unless the doctrine of Infallibility be
given up? that such concessions would set all other dissenters in
motion&mdash;an issue which has never fairly been met by the friends to
concession; and deeming the Church Establishment not only a fundamental
part of our constitution, but one of the greatest upholders and
propagators of civilization in our own country, and, lastly, the most
effectual and main support of religious Toleration, I cannot but look
with jealousy upon measures which must reduce her relative influence,
unless they be accompanied with arrangements more adequate than any yet
adopted for the preservation and increase of that influence, to keep
pace with the other powers in the community.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>{271}</span></p>

<p>I do not apologise for this long letter, the substance of which you may
report to any one worthy of a reply who, in your hearing, may animadvert
upon my political conduct. I ought to have added, perhaps, a word on
<i>local politics</i>, but I have not space; but what I should have said may
in a great measure be deduced from the above.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, near Ambleside, Jan. 12. 1816.</span><br />
<br />
DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>Though my sister, during my absence, has returned thanks in my name for
the verses which you have done me the honour of addressing to me, and
for the obliging letter which accompanies them, I feel it incumbent on
me, on my return home, to write a few words to the same purpose, with my
own hand.</p>

<p>It is always a satisfaction to me to learn that I have given pleasure
upon <i>rational</i> grounds; and I have nothing to object to your poetical
panegyric but the occasion which called it forth. An admirer of my
works, zealous as you have declared yourself to be, condescends too much
when he gives way to an impulse proceeding from the &mdash;&mdash;, or indeed from
any other Review. The writers in these publications, while they
prosecute their inglorious employment, cannot be supposed to be in a
state of mind very favourable for being affected by the finer influences
of a thing so pure as genuine poetry; and as to the instance which has
incited you to offer me this tribute of your gratitude, though I have
not seen it, I doubt not but that it is a splenetic effusion of the
conductor of that Review, who has taken a perpetual retainer from his
own incapacity to plead against my claims to public approbation.</p>

<p>I differ from you in thinking that the only poetical lines in your
address are 'stolen from myself.' The best verse, perhaps, is the
following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Awfully mighty in his impotence,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>{272}</span>which, by way of repayment, I may he tempted to steal from you on some
future occasion.</p>

<p>It pleases, though it does not surprise me, to learn that, having been
affected early in life by my verses, you have returned again to your old
loves after some little infidelities, which you were shamed into by
commerce with the scribbling and chattering part of the world. I have
heard of many who upon their first acquaintance with my poetry have had
much to get over before they could thoroughly relish it; but never of
one who having once learned to enjoy it, had ceased to value it, or
survived his admiration. This is as good an external assurance as I can
desire, that my inspiration is from a pure source, and that my
principles of composition are trustworthy.</p>

<p>With many thanks for your good wishes, and begging leave to offer mine
in return,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">I remain,</span><br />

<h3><a name="letter46" id="letter46" ></a>46. <i>Of the Thanksgiving Ode and 'White Doe of Rylston.'</i></h3>

<div class="center">LETTER TO ROBERT SOUTHEY.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">1816.</span><br />
MY DEAR SOUTHEY,<br />
</p>

<p>I am much of your mind in respect to my Ode. Had it been a hymn,
uttering the sentiments of a <i>multitude</i>, a <i>stanza</i> would have been
indispensable. But though I have called it a 'Thanksgiving Ode,'
strictly speaking it is not so, but a poem, composed, or supposed to be
composed, on the morning of the thanksgiving, uttering the sentiments of
an <i>individual</i> upon that occasion. It is a <i>dramatised ejaculation</i>;
and this, if any thing can, must excuse the irregular frame of the
metre. In respect to a <i>stanza</i> for a grand subject designed to be
treated comprehensively, there are great objections. If the stanza be
short, it will scarcely allow of fervour and impetuosity, unless so
short, as that the sense is run perpetually from one stanza to another,
as in Horace's Alcaics; and if it be long, it will be as apt to generate
diffuseness as to check it. Of this we have <span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>{273}</span>innumerable instances in
Spenser and the Italian poets. The sense required cannot he included in
one given stanza, so that another whole stanza is added, not
unfrequently, for the sake of matter which would naturally include
itself in a very few lines.</p>

<p>If Gray's plan be adopted, there is not time to become acquainted with
the arrangement, and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the
movement.</p>

<p>Be so good as to let me know where you found most difficulty in
following me. The passage which I most suspect of being misunderstood
is,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'And thus is missed the sole true glory;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the passage, where I doubt most about the reasonableness of
expecting that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the
imagery and the language, is the one that describes, under so many
metaphors, the spreading of the news of the Waterloo victory over the
globe. Tell me if this displeased you.</p>

<p>Do you know who reviewed 'The White Doe,' in the <i>Quarterly</i>? After
having asserted that Mr. W. uses his words without any regard to their
sense, the writer says, that on no other principle can he explain that
Emily is <i>always</i> called 'the consecrated Emily.' Now, the name Emily
occurs just fifteen times in the poem; and out of these fifteen, the
epithet is attached to it <i>once</i>, and that for the express purpose of
recalling the scene in which she had been consecrated by her brother's
solemn adjuration, that she would fulfil her destiny, and become a soul,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'By force of sorrows high<br /></span>
<span>Uplifted to the purest sky<br /></span>
<span>Of undisturbed mortality.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The point upon which the whole moral interest of the piece hinges, when
that speech is closed, occurs in this line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'He kissed the consecrated maid;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and to bring back this to the reader, I repeated the epithet.</p>

<p>The service I have lately rendered to Burns' genius<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> will one day be
performed to mine. The quotations, also, are printed with the most
culpable neglect of correctness: there are lines turned into nonsense.
Too much of this. Farewell!</p>

<h3><a name="letter47" id="letter47"><i>47. Of Poems in Stanzas</i>.</a></h3>
<br />
<div class="center">LETTER TO ROBERT SOUTHEY.</div>

<p>DEAR SOUTHEY,</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>My opinion in respect to <i>epic poetry</i> is much the same as the critic
whom Lucien Buonaparte has quoted in his preface. <i>Epic</i> poetry, of the
highest class, requires in the first place an action eminently
influential, an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences; it
next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man,
what the critics I believe call <i>machinery</i>; and, lastly, I think with
Dennis, that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the
soul in the highest class of this species of poetry. Now Tasso's is a
religious subject, and in my opinion, a most happy one; but I am
confidently of opinion that the <i>movement</i> of Tasso's poem rarely
corresponds with the essential character of the subject; nor do I think
it possible that written in <i>stanzas</i> it should. The celestial movement
cannot, I think, be kept up, if the sense is to be broken in that
despotic manner at the close of every eight lines. Spenser's stanza is
infinitely finer than the <i>ottaca rhima</i>, but even Spenser's will not
allow the epic movement as exhibited by Homer, Virgil, and Milton. How
noble is the first paragraph of the <i>Aeneid</i> in point of sound, compared
with the first stanza of the <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i>! The one winds with
the majesty of the Conscript Fathers entering the Senate House in solemn
procession; and the other has the pace of a set of recruits shuffling on
the drill-ground, and receiving from the adjutant or drill-serjeant the
commands to halt at every ten or twenty steps. Farewell.</p>

<h3><a name="letter48" id="letter48" ></a>48. <i>The Classics: Translation of Aeneid, &amp;c.</i></h3>

<p>[Laodamia, Dion, &amp;c.] These poems were written in 1814-16. About this
time Wordsworth's attention was given to the education of his eldest
son: this occupation appears to have been the occasion of their
composition. In preparing his son for his university career, he
reperused the principal Latin poets;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>{275}</span> and doubtless the careful study of
their works was not without a beneficial influence on his own. It
imparted variety and richness to his conceptions, and shed new graces on
his style, and rescued his poems from the charge of mannerism.</p>

<p>Among the fruits of this course of reading, was a translation of some of
the earlier books of VIRGIL'S AENEID. Three books were finished. This
version was not executed in blank verse, but in rhyme; not, however, in
the style of Pope, but with greater freedom and vigour. A specimen of
this translation was contributed by Wordsworth to the <i>Philological
Museum</i>, printed at Cambridge in 1832.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> It was accompanied with the

<br />
<i>To the editor off the Philological Museum</i>.</div>
<br />
<p>Your letter reminding me of an expectation I some time since held out to
you, of allowing some specimens of my translation from the <i>Aeneid</i> to
be printed in the <i>Philological Museum</i>, was not very acceptable; for I
had abandoned the thought of ever sending into the world any part of
that experiment&mdash;for it was nothing more&mdash;an experiment begun for
amusement, and, I now think, a less fortunate one than when I first
named it to you. Having been displeased, in modern translations, with
the additions of incongruous matter, I began to translate with a resolve
to keep clear of that fault, by adding nothing; but I became convinced
that a spirited translation can scarcely be accomplished in the English
language without admitting a principle of compensation. On this point,
however, I do not wish to insist; and merely send the following passage,
taken at random, from a wish to comply with your request.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your obliging letter. I shall be much gratified if you
happen to like my translation, and thankful for any remarks with which
you may honour me. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>{276}</span> made so much progress with the second book,
that I defer sending the former till that is finished. It takes in many
places a high tone of passion, which I would gladly succeed in
rendering. When I read Virgil in the original I am moved; but not so
much so by the translation; and I cannot but think this owing to a
defect in the diction, which I have endeavoured to supply, with what
success you will easily be enabled to judge.</p>

passages that are faulty, in your view of the case? We seem pretty much
of opinion upon the subject of rhyme. Pentameters, where the sense has a
close of some sort at every two lines, may be rendered in regularly
closed couplets; but hexameters (especially the Virgilian, that run the
lines into each other for a great length) cannot. I have long been
persuaded that Milton formed his blank verse upon the model of the
<i>Georgics</i> and the <i>Aeneid</i>, and I am so much struck with this
resemblance, that I should have attempted Virgil in blank verse, had I
not been persuaded that no ancient author can be with advantage so
rendered. Their religion, their warfare, their course of action and
feeling, are too remote from modern interest to allow it. We require
every possible help and attraction of sound, in our language, to smooth
the way for the admission of things so remote from our present concerns.
My own notion of translation is, that it cannot be too literal, provided
three faults be avoided: <i>baldness</i>, in which I include all that takes
from dignity; and <i>strangeness</i> or <i>uncouthness</i>, including harshness;
and lastly, attempts to convey meanings which, as they cannot be given
but by languid circumlocutions, cannot in fact be said to be given at
all. I will trouble you with an instance in which I fear this fault
exists. Virgil, describing Aeneas's voyage, third book, verse 551,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Hinc sinus Herculei, si vera est fama. Tarenti<br /></span>
<span>Cernitur.'<br /></span>
</div></div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>{277}</span>
<p>I render it thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Hence we behold the bay that bears the name<br /></span>
<span>Of proud Tarentum, proud to share the fame<br /></span>
<span>Of Hercules, though by a dubious claim.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I was unable to get the meaning with tolerable harmony into fewer words,
which are more than to a modern reader, perhaps, it is worth.</p>

<p>I feel much at a loss, without the assistance of the marks which I have
requested, to take an exact measure of your Lordship's feelings with
regard to the diction. To save you the trouble of reference, I will
transcribe two passages from Dryden; first, the celebrated appearance of
Hector's ghost to Aeneas. Aeneas thus addresses him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'O light of Trojans and support of Troy,<br /></span>
<span>Thy father's champion, and thy country s joy,<br /></span>
<span>O long expected by thy friends, from whence<br /></span>
<span>Art thou returned, so late for our defence?<br /></span>
<span>Do we behold thee, wearied as we are<br /></span>
<span>With length of labours and with toils of war?<br /></span>
<span>After so many funerals of thy own,<br /></span>
<span>Art thou restored to thy declining town?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This I think not an unfavourable specimen of Dryden's way of treating
the solemnly pathetic passages. Yet, surely, here is <i>nothing</i> of the
<i>cadence</i> of the original, and little of its spirit. The second verse is
not in the original, and ought not to have been in Dryden; for it
anticipates the beautiful hemistich,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Sat patriae Priamoque datum.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By the by, there is the same sort of anticipation in a spirited and
harmonious couplet preceding:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Such as he was when by <i>Pelides slain</i><br /></span>
<span>Thessalian coursers dragged him o'er the plain.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This introduction of Pelides here is not in Virgil, because it would
have prevented the effect of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Redit exuvias indutus Achillei.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is a striking solemnity in the answer of Pantheus to Aeneas:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Venit summa dies et ineluctabile tempus<br /></span>
<span>Dardaniae: fuimus Tro&euml;s, fuit Ilium, et ingens<br /></span>
<span>Gloria Teucrorum,' &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dryden thus gives it:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>{278}</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">'Then Pantheus, with a groan,<br /></span>
<span>Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town.<br /></span>
<span>The fatal day, the appointed hour is come<br /></span>
<span>When wrathful Jove's irrevocable doom<br /></span>
<span>Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands.<br /></span>
<span>The fire consumes the town, the foe commands.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>My own translation runs thus; and I quote it because it occurred to my
mind immediately on reading your Lordship's observations:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">'Tis come, the final hour,<br /></span>
<span>Th' inevitable close of Dardan power<br /></span>
<span>Hath come! we <i>have</i> been Trojans, Ilium <i>was</i>,<br /></span>
<span>And the great name of Troy; now all things pass<br /></span>
<span>To Argos. So wills angry Jupiter.<br /></span>
<span>Amid a burning town the Grecians domineer.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I cannot say that '<i>we have been</i>,' and 'Ilium <i>was</i>,' are as sonorous
sounds as 'fuimus,' and 'fuit;' but these latter must have been as
familiar to the Romans as the former to ourselves. I should much like to
know if your Lordship disapproves of my translation here. I have one
word to say upon ornament. It was my wish and labour that my translation
should have far more of the <i>genuine</i> ornaments of Virgil than my
predecessors. Dryden has been very careless of these, and profuse of his
own, which seem to me very rarely to harmonise with those of Virgil; as,
for example, describing Hector's appearance in the passage above alluded
to,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'A <i>bloody shroud</i>, he seemed, and <i>bath'd</i> in tears.<br /></span>
<span>I wept to see the <i>visionary</i> man.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'And all the wounds he for his country bore<br /></span>
<span>Now streamed afresh, and with <i>new purple ran</i>.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I feel it, however, to be too probable that my translation is deficient
in ornament, because I must unavoidably have lost many of Virgil's, and
have never without reluctance attempted a compensation of my own. Had I
taken the liberties of my predecessors, Dryden especially, I could have
translated nine books with the labour that three have cost me. The third
book, being of a humbler character than either of the former, I have
treated with rather less scrupulous apprehension, and have interwoven a
little of my own; and, with permission, I will send it, ere long, for
the benefit of your Lordship's observations, which really will be of
great service to me if I proceed. Had I begun the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>{279}</span> fifteen years
ago, I should have finished it with pleasure; at present, I fear it will
take more time than I either can or ought to spare. I do not think of
going beyond the fourth book.</p>

<p>As to the MS., be so kind as to forward it at your leisure to me, at Sir
George Beaumont's, Coleorton Hall, near Ashby, whither I am going in
about ten days. May I trouble your Lordship with our respectful
compliments to Lady Lonsdale?</p>

<h3><a name="letter50" id="letter50" ></a>50. <i>Tour on the Continent, 1820</i>.</h3>

<div class="center">LETTERS TO THE EARL OF LONSDALE.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Lucerne, Aug. 19. 1820.</span><br />
MY LORD,<br />
</p>

<p>You did me the honour of expressing a wish to hear from me during my
continental tour; accordingly, I have great pleasure in writing from
this place, where we arrived three days ago. Our route has lain through
Brussels, Namur, along the banks of the Meuse, to Liege; thence to
Aix-la-Chapelle, Cologne, and along the Rhine to Mayence, to Frankfort,
Heidelberg (a noble situation, at the point where the Neckar issues from
steep lofty hills into the plain of the Rhine), Carlsruhe, and through
the Black Forest to Schaffhausen; thence to Zurich, Berne, Thun,
Interlachen. Here our Alpine tour might be said to commence, which has
produced much pleasure thus far, and nothing that deserves the name of
difficulty, even for the ladies. From the Valley of Lauterbrunnen we
crossed the Wengern Alp to Grindelwald, and then over the grand Sheideck
to Meyringen. This journey led us over high ground, and for fifteen
leagues along the base of the loftiest Alps, which reared their bare or
snow-clad ridges and pikes, in a clear atmosphere, with fleecy clouds
now and then settling upon and gathering round them. We heard and saw
several avalanches; they are announced by a sound like thunder, but more
metallic and musical. This warning naturally makes one look about, and
we had the gratification of seeing one falling, in the shape and
appearance of a torrent or cascade of foaming water, down the deep-worn
crevices of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>{280}</span> steep or perpendicular granite mountains. Nothing can
be more awful than the sound of these cataracts of ice and snow thus
descending, unless it be the silence which succeeds. The elevations from
which we beheld these operations of Nature, and saw such an immense
range of primitive mountains stretching to the east and west, were
covered with rich pasturage and beautiful flowers, among which was
abundance of the monkshood, a flower which I had never seen but in the
trim borders of our gardens, and which here grew not so much in patches
as in little woods or forests, towering above the other plants. At this
season the herdsmen are with their cattle in still higher regions than
those which we have trod, the herbage where we travelled being reserved
till they descend in the autumn. We have visited the Abbey of Engelberg,
not many leagues from the borders of the Lake of Lucerne. The tradition
is, that the site of the abbey was appointed by angels, singing from a
lofty mountain that rises from the plain of the valley, and which, from
having been thus honoured, is called Engelberg, or the Hill of the
Angels. It is a glorious position for such beings, and I should have
thought myself repaid for the trouble of so long a journey by the
impression made upon my mind, when I first came in view of the vale in
which the convent is placed, and of the mountains that enclose it. The
light of the sun had left the valley, and the deep shadows spread over
it heightened the splendour of the evening light, and spread upon the
surrounding mountains, some of which had their summits covered with pure
snow; others were half hidden by vapours rolling round them; and the
Rock of Engelberg could not have been seen under more fortunate
circumstances, for masses of cloud glowing with the reflection of the
rays of the setting sun were hovering round it, like choirs of spirits
preparing to settle upon its venerable head.</p>

<p>To-day we quit this place to ascend the mountain Righi. We shall be
detained in this neighbourhood till our passports are returned from
Berne, signed by the Austrian minister, which we find absolutely
necessary to enable us to proceed into the <i>Milanese</i>. At the end of
five weeks at the latest, we hope to reach Geneva, returning by the
Simplon Pass. There I might have the pleasure of hearing from your
Lordship; and may I beg that you would not omit to mention our
Westmoreland politics? The diet of Switzerland is now sitting in this
place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>{281}</span> Yesterday I had a long conversation with the Bavarian envoy,
whose views of the state of Europe appear to me very just. This letter
must unavoidably prove dull to your Lordship, but when I have the
pleasure of seeing you, I hope to make some little amends, though I feel
this is a very superficial way of viewing a country, even with reference
merely to the beauties of Nature. We have not met with many English;
there is scarcely a third part as many in the country as there was last
year. A brother of Lord Grey is in the house where we now are, and Lord
Ashburton left yesterday. I must conclude abruptly, with kindest
remembrances to Lady Lonsdale and Lady Mary. Believe me, my Lord, most
faithfully</p>

MY LORD,<br />
</p>

<p>I had the honour of writing to your Lordship from Lucerne, 19th of
August, giving an account of our movements. We have visited, since,
those parts of Switzerland usually deemed most worthy of notice, and the
Italian lakes, having stopped four days at Milan, and as many at Geneva.
With the exception of a couple of days on the Lake of Geneva, the
weather has been most favourable, though frequently during the last
fortnight extremely cold. We have had no detention from illness, nor any
bad accident, for which we feel more grateful, on account of some of our
fellow travellers, who accidentally joined us for a few days. Of these,
one, an American gentleman, was drowned in the Lake of Zurich, by the
upsetting of a boat in a storm, two or three days after he parted with
us; and two others, near the summit of Mount Jura, and in the middle of
a tempestuous night, were precipitated, they scarcely knew how far,
along with one of those frightful and ponderous vehicles, a continental
diligence. We have been in Paris since Sunday last, and think of staying
about a fortnight longer, as scarcely less will suffice for even a hasty
view of the town and neighbourhood. We took Fontainebleau in our way,
and intend giving a day to Versailles. The day we entered Paris we
passed a well-drest young man and woman, dragging a harrow through a
field, like cattle; nevertheless, working in the fields on the sabbath
day does not appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>{282}</span> be general in France. On the same day a
wretched-looking person begged of us, as the carriage was climbing a
hill. Nothing could exceed his transport in receiving a pair of old
pantaloons which were handed out of the carriage. This poor mendicant,
the postilion told us, was an <i>ancien Cur&eacute;</i>. The churches seem generally
falling into decay in the country. We passed one which had been recently
repaired. I have noticed, however, several young persons, men as well as
women, earnestly employed in their devotions, in different churches,
both in Paris and elsewhere. Nothing which I have seen in this city has
interested me at all like the Jardin des Plantes, with the living
animals, and the Museum of Natural History which it includes. Scarcely
could I refrain from tears of admiration at the sight of this apparently
boundless exhibition of the wonders of the creation. The statues and
pictures of the Louvre affect me feebly in comparison. The exterior of
Paris is much changed since I last visited it in 1792. I miss many
ancient buildings, particularly the Temple, where the poor king and his
family were so long confined. That memorable spot, where the Jacobin
Club was held, has also disappeared. Nor are the additional buildings
always improvements; the Pont des Arts, in particular, injures the view
from the Pont Neuf greatly; but in these things public convenience is
the main point.</p>

<p>I say nothing of public affairs, for I have little opportunity of
knowing anything about them. In respect to the business of our Queen, we
deem ourselves truly fortunate in having been out of the country at a
time when an inquiry, at which all Europe seems scandalised, was going
on.</p>

<p>I have purposely deferred congratulating your Lordship on the marriage
of Lady Mary with Lord Frederick Bentinck, which I hear has been
celebrated. My wishes for her happiness are most earnest.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">Rydal Mount, Nov. 27. 1828.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR C&mdash;&mdash;,<br />
</p>

<p>It gives me much pleasure to learn that your residence in France has
answered so well. As I had recommended the step, I felt more especially
anxious to be informed of the result. I have only to regret that you did
not tell me whether the interests of a foreign country and a brilliant
metropolis had encroached more upon the time due to academical studies
than was proper.</p>

<p>As to the revolution which Mr. D&mdash;&mdash; calculates upon, I agree with him
that a great change must take place, but not altogether, or even mainly,
from the causes which he looks to, if I be right in conjecturing that he
expects that the religionists who have at present such influence over
the king's mind will be predominant. The extremes to which they wish to
carry things are not sufficiently in the spirit of the age to suit their
purpose. The French monarchy must undergo a great change, or it will
fall altogether. A constitution of government so disproportioned cannot
endure. A monarchy, without a powerful aristocracy or nobility
graduating into a gentry, and so downwards, cannot long subsist. This is
wanting in France, and must continue to be wanting till the restrictions
imposed on the disposal of property by will, through the Code Napoleon,
are done away with: and it may be observed, by the by, that there is a
bareness, some would call it a simplicity, in that code which unfits it
for a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>{284}</span>complex state of society like that of France, so that evasions
and stretchings of its provisions are already found necessary, to a
degree which will ere long convince the French people of the necessity
of disencumbering themselves of it. But to return. My apprehension is,
that for the cause assigned, the French monarchy may fall before an
aristocracy can be raised to give it necessary support. The great
monarchies of Russia, Prussia, and Austria, having not yet been subject
to popular revolutions, are still able to maintain themselves, through
the old feudal <i>forces</i> and qualities, with something, not much, of the
feudal <i>virtues</i>. This cannot be in France; popular inclinations are
much too strong&mdash;thanks, I will say so far, to the Revolution. How is a
government fit for her condition to be supported, but by religion, and a
spirit of honour, or refined conscience? Now religion, in a widely
extended country plentifully peopled, cannot be preserved from abuse of
priestly influence, and from superstition and fanaticism, nor honour be
an operating principle upon a large scale, except through
<i>property</i>&mdash;that is, such accumulations of it, graduated as I have
mentioned above, through the community. Thus and thus only can be had
exemption from temptation to low habits of mind, leisure for solid
education, and dislike to innovation, from a sense in the several
classes how much they have to lose; for circumstances often make men
wiser, or at least more discreet, when their individual levity or
presumption would dispose them to be much otherwise. To what extent that
constitution of character which is produced by property makes up for the
decay of chivalrous loyalty and strengthens governments, may be seen by
comparing the officers of the English army with those of Prussia, &amp;c.
How far superior are ours as gentlemen! so much so that British officers
can scarcely associate with those of the Continent, not from pride, but
instinctive aversion to their low propensities. But I cannot proceed,
and ought, my dear C&mdash;&mdash;, to crave your indulgence for so long a prose.</p>

<p>When you see Frere, pray give him my kind regards, and say that he shall
hear from me the first frank I can procure. Farewell, with kindest love
from all,</p>

<h3><a name="letter53" id="letter53"></a>53. <i>Style: Francis Edgeworth's 'Dramatic Fragment:' Criticisms</i>.</h3>

<p>I should say [to your young friend] style is in Poetry of incalculable
importance. He seems, however, aware of it, for his diction is obviously
studied. Now the great difficulty is to determine what constitutes a
good style. In estimating this we are all subject to delusion, not
improbably I am so, when it appears to me that the metaphor in the first
speech of his dramatic scene is too much drawn out. It does not pass off
as rapidly as metaphors ought to do, I think, in dramatic writing. I am
well aware that our early dramatists abound with these continuities of
imagery, but to me they appear laboured and unnatural, at least unsuited
to that species of composition, of which action and motion are the
essentials. 'While with the ashes of a light that was,' and the two
following lines, are in the best style of dramatic writing. To every
opinion thus given always add, I pray you, 'in my judgment,' though I
may not, to save trouble or to avoid a charge of false modesty, express
it. 'This over-pressure of a heavy pleasure,' &amp;c., is admirable; and,
indeed, it would be tedious to praise all that pleases me. Shelley's
'Witch of Atlas' I never saw; therefore the stanza referring to
Narcissus and her was read by me to some disadvantage. One observation I
am about to make will at least prove I am no flatterer, and will
therefore give a qualified value to my praise.</p>

<p>Many thanks for the review: your article is excellent. I only wish that
you had said more of the deserts of government in respect to Ireland;
since I do sincerely believe that no government in Europe has shown
better dispositions to its subjects than the English have done to the
Irish, and that no country has improved so much during the same period.
You have adverted to this part of the subject, but not spoken so
forcibly as I could have wished. There is another point might be
insisted upon more expressly than you have done&mdash;the danger, not to say
the absurdity, of Roman Catholic legislation for the property of a
<i>Protestant</i> church, so inadequately <i>represented in Parliament</i> as ours
is. The Convocation is gone; clergymen are excluded from the House of
Commons; and the Bishops are at the beck of Ministers. I boldly ask what
real property of the country is so inadequately represented: it is a
mere mockery.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Thursday Night, Feb. 26. 1829.</span><br />
</p>

<p>You ask for my opinion on the Roman Catholic Question.</p>

<p>I dare scarcely trust my pen to the notice of the question which the
Duke of Wellington tells us is about to be <i>settled</i>. One thing no
rational person will deny, that the experiment is hazardous. Equally
obvious is it that the timidity, supineness, and other unworthy
qualities of the government for many years past have produced the
danger, the extent of which they now<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>{287}</span> affirm imposes a necessity of
granting all that the Romanists demand. Now, it is rather too much that
the country should be called upon to take the measure of this danger
from the very men who may almost be said to have created it. Danger is a
relative thing, and the first requisite for judging of what we have to
dread from the physical force of the Roman Catholics is to be in
sympathy with the Protestants. Had our Ministers been so, could they
have suffered themselves to be bearded by the Catholic Association for
so many years?</p>

<p>C&mdash;&mdash;, if I may take leave to say it, loses sight of <i>things</i> in
<i>names</i>, when he says that they should not be admitted as Roman
Catholics, but simply as British subjects. The question before us is,
Can Protestantism and Popery be coordinate powers in the constitution of
a <i>free</i> country, and at the same time Christian belief be in that
country a vital principle of action?</p>

<p>I fear not. Heaven grant I may be deceived!</p>

<p>There is one point also delicate to touch upon and hazardous to deal
with, but of prime importance in this crisis. The question, as under the
conduct of the present Ministers, is closely connecting itself with
religion. Now after all, if we are to be preserved from utter confusion,
it is religion and morals, and conscience, which must do the work. The
religious part of the community, especially those attached to the Church
of England, must and <i>do</i> feel that neither the Church as an

<div class="center">LETTER TO G. HUNTLY GORDON, ESQ.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Dec. 1. 1829.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>You must not go to Ireland without applying to me, as the guide-books
for the most part are sorry things, and mislead by their exaggerations.
If I were a younger man, and could prevail upon an able artist to
accompany me, there are few things I should like better than giving a
month or six weeks to explore the county of Kerry only. A judicious
topographical work on that district would be really useful, both for the
lovers of Nature and the observers of manners. As to the Giant's
Causeway and the coast of Antrim, you cannot go wrong; there the
interests obtrude themselves on every one's notice.</p>

<p>The subject of the Poor Laws was never out of my sight whilst I was in
Ireland; it seems to me next to impossible to introduce a general system
of such laws, principally for two reasons: the vast numbers that would
have equal claims for relief, and the non-existence of a class capable
of looking with effect to their administration. Much is done at present
in many places (Derry, for example) by voluntary contributions; but the
narrow-minded escape from the burthen, which falls unreasonably upon the
charitable; so that assessments in the best-disposed places are to be
wished for, could they be effected without producing a greater evil.</p>

<p>The great difficulty that is complained of in the well-managed places is
the floating poor, who cannot be excluded, I am told, by any existing
law from quartering themselves where they like. Open begging is not
practised in many places, but there is no law by which the poor can be
prevented from returning to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>{289}</span> place which they may have quitted
voluntarily, or from which they have been expelled (as I was told). Were
it not for this obstacle compulsory local regulations might, I think, be
applied in many districts with good effect.</p>

<p>It would be unfair to myself to quit this momentous subject without
adding that I am a zealous friend to the great principle of the Poor
Laws, as tending, if judiciously applied, much more to elevate than to
depress the character of the labouring classes. I have never seen this
truth developed as it ought to be in parliament.</p>

<p>The day I dined with Lord F.L. Gower at his official residence in the
Phoenix Park, I met there with an intelligent gentleman, Mr. Page, who
was travelling in Ireland expressly to collect information upon this
subject, which, no doubt, he means to publish. If you should hear of
this pamphlet when it comes out procure it, for I am persuaded it will
prove well worth reading. Farewell.</p>

<div class="center">TWO LETTERS TO THE VENERABLE ARCHDEACON WRANGHAM.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Feb. 19. 1819.</span><br />
<br />
DEAR WRANGHAM,<br />
</p>

<p>I received your kind letter last night, for which you will accept my
thanks. I write upon the spur of that mark of your regard, or my
aversion to letter-writing might get the better of me.</p>

<p>I find it difficult to speak publicly of good men while alive,
especially if they are persons who have power. The world ascribes the
eulogy to interested motives, or to an adulatory spirit, which I detest.
But of LORD LONSDALE, I will say to you, that I do not think there
exists in England a man of any rank more anxiously desirous to discharge
his duty in that state of life to which it has pleased God to call him.
His thought and exertions are constantly directed to that object; and
the more he is known the more is he beloved, and respected, and admired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>{290}</span></p>

<p>I ought to have thanked you before for your version of VIRGIL'S
ECLOGUES, which reached me at last. I have lately compared it line for
line with the original, and think it very well done. I was particularly
pleased with the skill you have shown in managing the contest between
the shepherds in the third Pastoral, where you have included in a
succession of couplets the sense of Virgil's paired hexameters. I think
I mentioned to you that these poems of Virgil have always delighted me
much; there is frequently either an elegance or a happiness which no
translation can hope to equal. In point of fidelity your translation is
very good indeed.</p>

<p>You astonish me with the account of your books; and I should have been
still more astonished if you had told me you had read a third (shall I
say a tenth part?) of them. My reading powers were never very good, and
now they are much diminished, especially by candle-light; and as to
<i>buying</i> books, I can affirm that in <i>new</i> books I have not spent five
shillings for the last five years, <i>i.e.</i>, in Reviews, Magazines,
Pamphlets, &amp;c. &amp;c.; so that there would be an end of Mr. Longman, and
Mr. Cadell, &amp;c. &amp;c., if nobody had more power or inclination to buy than
myself. And as to old books, my dealings in that way, for want of means,
have been very trifling. Nevertheless, small and paltry as my collection
is, I have not read a fifth part of it. I should, however, like to see
your army.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span>When Agrican, with fill his <i>northern</i> powers,<br /></span>
<span>Besieged Albracca, as <i>romances</i> tell.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not that I accuse you of romancing; I verily believe that you have all
the books you speak of. Dear Wrangham, are you and I ever like to meet
in this world again? <i>Yours</i> is a <i>corner</i> of the earth; <i>mine</i> is <i>not</i>
so. I never heard of anybody going to Bridlington; but all the world
comes to the Lakes. Farewell. Excuse this wretched scrawl; it is like
all that proceeds from, my miserable pen.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>DEAR WRANGHAM,</p>

<p>You are very good in sending one letter after another to inquire after a
person so undeserving of attentions of this kind as myself. Dr. Johnson,
I think, observes, or rather is made to observe by some of his
biographers, that no man delights to <i>give</i> what he is accustomed to
<i>sell</i>. 'For example: you, Mr. Thrale, would rather part with anything
in this way than your porter.' Now, though I have never been much of a
salesman in matters of literature (the whole of my returns&mdash;I do not say
<i>net profits</i>, but <i>returns</i>&mdash;from the writing trade, not amounting to
seven score pounds), yet, somehow or other, I manufacture a letter, and
part with it as reluctantly as if it were really a thing of price. But,
to drop the comparison, I have so much to do with writing, in the way of
labour and profession, that it is difficult to me to conceive how
anybody can take up a pen but from constraint. My writing-desk is to me
a place of punishment; and, as my penmanship sufficiently testifies. I
always bend over it with some degree of impatience. All this is said
that you may know the real cause of my silence, and not ascribe it in
any degree to slight or forgetfulness on my part, or an insensibility to
your worth and the value of your friendship.... As to my occupations,
they look little at the present age; but I live in hope of leaving
something behind me that by some minds will be valued.</p>

<p>I see no new books except by the merest accident. Of course your poem,
which I should have been pleased to read, has not found its way to me.
You inquire about old books: you might almost as well have asked for my
teeth as for any of mine. The only <i>modern</i> books that I read are those
of Travels, or such as relate to matters of fact; and the only modern
books that I care for; but as to old ones, I am like yourself&mdash;scarcely
anything comes amiss to me. The little time I have to spare&mdash;the very
little, I may say&mdash;all goes that way. If, however, in the <i>line of your
profession</i> you want any bulky old Commentaries on the Scriptures (such
as not twelve strong men of these degenerate days will venture&mdash;I do not
say to <i>read</i>, but to <i>lift</i>), I can, perhaps, as a special favour,
accommodate you.</p>

<p>I and mine will be happy to see you and yours here or anywhere; but I am
sorry the time you talk of is so distant: a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>{292}</span> year and a half is a long
time looking forward, though looking back ten times as much is as brief
as a dream. My writing is wholly illegible&mdash;at least I fear so; I had
better, therefore, release you.</p>

<p>DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>It is some time since I received your little volume, for which I now
return you my thanks, and also for the obliging letter that accompanied
it.</p>

<p>Your poem I have read with no inconsiderable pleasure; it is full of
natural sentiments and pleasing pictures: among the minor pieces, the
last pleased me much the best, and especially the latter part of it.
This little volume, with what I saw of yourself during a short
interview, interest me in your welfare; and the more so, as I always
feel some apprehension for the destiny of those who in youth addict
themselves to the composition of verse. It is a very seducing
employment, and, though begun in disinterested love of the Muses, is too
apt to connect itself with self-love, and the disquieting passions which
follow in the train of that our natural infirmity. Fix your eye upon
acquiring independence by honourable business, and let the Muses come
after rather than go before. Such lines as the latter of this couplet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Where lovely woman, chaste as heaven above.<br /></span>
<span>Shines in the golden virtues of her love,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and many other passages in your poem, give proof of no common-place
sensibility. I am therefore the more earnest that you should guard
yourself against this temptation.</p>

<p>Excuse this freedom; and believe me, my dear Sir, very faithfully,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, near Kendal, Sept. 24. 1827.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>You will have no pain to suffer from my sincerity. With a safe
conscience I can assure you that in my judgment your verses are animated
with true poetic spirit, as they are evidently the product of strong
feeling. The sixth and seventh stanzas affected me much, even to the
dimming of my eye and faltering of my voice while I was reading them
aloud. Having said this, I have said enough; now for the <i>per contra</i>.</p>

<p>You will not, I am sure, be hurt, when I tell you that the workmanship
(what else could be expected from so young a writer?) is not what it
ought to be; even in those two affecting stanzas it is not perfect:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Some touch of human sympathy find way,<br /></span>
<span>And whisper that though Truth's and Science' ray<br /></span>
<span>With such serene effulgence o'er thee shone.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sympathy might whisper, but a '<i>touch</i> of sympathy' could not. 'Truth's
and Science' ray,' for the ray of truth and science, is not only
extremely harsh, but a 'ray <i>shone</i>' is, if not absolutely a pleonasm, a
great awkwardness: 'a ray fell' or 'shot' may be said, and a sun or a
moon or a candle shone, but not a ray. I much regret that I did not
receive these verses while you were here, that I might have given you,
<i>viv&acirc; voce</i>, a comment upon them, which would be tedious by letter, and
after all very imperfect. If I have the pleasure of seeing you again, I
will beg permission to dissect these verses, or any other you may be
inclined to show me; but I am certain that without conference with me,
or any benefit drawn from my practice in metrical composition, your own
high powers of mind will lead you to the main conclusions.</p>

<p>You will be brought to acknowledge that the logical faculty has
infinitely more to do with poetry than the young and the inexperienced,
whether writer or critic, ever dreams of. Indeed, as the materials upon
which that faculty is exorcised in poetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>{294}</span> are so subtle, so plastic, so
complex, the application of it requires an adroitness which can proceed
from nothing but practice, a discernment which emotion is so far from
bestowing that at first it is ever in the way of it. Here I must stop:
only let me advert to two lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'But shall despondence therefore <i>blench</i> my <i>brow</i>,<br /></span>
<span>Or pining sorrow sickly ardor o'er.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These are two of the worst lines in mere expression. 'Blench' is perhaps
miswritten for 'blanch;' if not, I don't understand the word. <i>Blench</i>
signifies to flinch. If 'blanch' be the word, the next ought to be
'<i>hair</i>.' You cannot here use <i>brow</i> for the <i>hair</i> upon it, because a
white brow or forehead is a beautiful characteristic of youth. 'Sickly
ardor o'er' was at first reading to me unintelligible. I took 'sickly'
to be an adjective joined with 'ardor,' whereas you mean it as a portion
of a verb, from Shakspeare, 'Sicklied o'er with the pale cast of
thought.' But the separation of the parts or decomposition of the word,
as here done, is not to be endured.</p>

<p>Let me now come to your sister's verses, for which I thank you. They are
surprisingly vigorous for a female pen, but occasionally too rugged, and
especially for such a subject; they have also the same faults in
expression as your own, but not, I think, in quite an equal degree. Much
is to be hoped from feelings so strong, and from a mind thus disposed. I
should have entered into particulars with these also, had I seen you
after they came into my hands. Your sister is, no doubt, aware that in
her poem she has trodden the same ground as Gray, in his 'Ode upon a
distant Prospect of Eton College.' What he has been contented to treat
in the abstract, she has represented in particular, and with admirable
spirit. But again, my dear Sir, let me exhort you (and do you exhort
your sister) to deal little with modern writers, but fix your attention
almost exclusively upon those who have stood the test of time. <i>You</i>
have not leisure to allow of your being tempted to turn aside from the
right course by deceitful lights. My household desire to be remembered
to you in no formal way. Seldom have I parted, never I was going to say,
with one whom after so short an acquaintance, I lost sight of with more
regret. I trust we shall meet again, if not [sentence cut off with the
autograph]. Postscript. Pray do not forget to remember me to Mr. Otway.
I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>{295}</span> was much pleased with him and with your fellow-traveller Mr. Nimmo,
as I should have been, no doubt, with the young Irishman, had not our
conversation taken so serious a turn. The passage in Tacitus which
Milton's line so strongly resembles is not in the 'Agricola,' nor can I
find it, but it exists somewhere.</p>

DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>I regret to hear of the indisposition from which you have been
suffering.</p>

<p>That you are convinced<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> gives me great pleasure, as I hope that every
other editor of Collins will follow your example. You are at perfect
liberty to declare that you have rejected Bell's copy in consequence of
my opinion of it; and I feel much satisfaction in being the instrument
of rescuing the memory of Collins from this disgrace. I have always felt
some concern that Mr. Home, who lived several years after Bell's
publication, did not testify more regard for his deceased friend's
memory by protesting against this imposition. Mr. Mackenzie is still
living; and I shall shortly have his opinion upon the question; and if
it be at all interesting, I shall take the liberty of sending it to you.</p>


<p>Dyer is another of our minor poets&mdash;minor as to quantity&mdash;of whom one
would wish to know more. Particulars about him might still be collected,
I should think, in South Wales, his native country, and where in early
life he practised as a painter. I have often heard Sir George Beaumont
express a curiosity about his pictures, and a wish to see any specimen
of his pencil that might survive. If you are a rambler, perhaps you may,
at some time or other, be led into Carmarthenshire, and might bear in
mind what I have just said of this excellent author.</p>

<p>I had once a hope to have learned some unknown particulars of Thomson,
about Jedburgh, but I was disappointed. Had I succeeded, I meant to
publish a short life of him, prefixed to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>{296}</span> volume containing 'The
Seasons,' 'The Castle of Indolence,' his minor pieces in rhyme, and a
few extracts from his plays, and his 'Liberty;' and I feel still
inclined to do something of the kind. These three writers, Thomson,
Collins, and Dyer, had more poetic imagination than any of their
contemporaries, unless we reckon Chatterton as of that age. I do not
name Pope, for he stands alone, as a man most highly gifted; but
unluckily he took the plain when the heights were within his reach.</p>

<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>I have been very long in your debt. An inflammation in my eyes cut me
off from writing and reading, so that I deem it still prudent to employ
an Amanuensis; but I had a more decisive reason for putting off payment,
nothing less than the hope that I might discharge my debt in person: it
seems better, however, to consult you beforehand. I wish to make a Tour
in Ireland, and <i>perhaps</i> along with my daughter, but I am ignorant of
so many points, as where to begin, whether it be safe at this <i>rioting</i>
period, what is best worth seeing, what mode of travelling will furnish
the greatest advantages at the least expense. Dublin of course&mdash;the
Wicklow mountains&mdash;Killarney Lakes&mdash;and I think the ruins not far from
Limerick would be among my objects, and return by the North; but I can
form no conjecture as to the time requisite for this, and whether it
would be best to take the steamboat from Liverpool to Cork, beginning
there, or to go from Whitehaven to Dublin. To start from Whitehaven by
steam to Dublin would suit me as being nearer this place and a shorter
voyage; besides my son is settled near Whitehaven, and I could
conveniently embark from his abode.</p>

<p>I have read with great pleasure the 'Sketches in Ireland' which Mr.
Otway was kind enough to present to me; but many<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>{297}</span> interesting things he
speaks of in the West will be quite out of my reach. In short I am as
unprepared with Tourists' information as any man can be, and sensible as
I am of the very great value of your time, I cannot refrain from begging
you to take pity upon my ignorance and to give me some information,
keeping in mind the possibility of my having a female companion.</p>

<p>It is time to thank you for the verses you so obligingly sent me.</p>

<p>Your sister's have abundance of spirit and feeling; all that they want
is what appears in itself of little moment, and yet is of incalculably
great,&mdash;that is, workmanship,&mdash;the art by which the thoughts are made to
melt into each other, and to fall into light and shadow, regulated by
distinct preconception of the best general effect they are capable of
producing. This may seem very vague to you, but by conversation I think
I could make it appear otherwise. It is enough for the present to say
that I was much gratified, and beg you would thank your sister for
favouring me with the sight of compositions so distinctly marked with
that quality which is the subject of them ['Genius']. Your own verses
are to me very interesting, and affect me much as evidences of high and
pure-mindedness, from which humble-mindedness is inseparable. I like to
see and think of you among the stars, and between death and immortality,
where three of these poems place you. The 'Dream of Chivalry' is also
interesting in another way; but it would be insincere not to say that
something of a style more terse, and a harmony more accurately balanced,
must be acquired before the bodily form of your verses will be quite
worthy of their living soul. You are probably aware of this, tho'
perhaps not in an equal degree with myself; nor is it desirable you
should, for it might tempt you to labour, which would divert you from
subjects of infinitely greater importance.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your interesting account of Mr. Edgeworth. I heartily
concur with you in the wish that neither Plato nor any other profane
author may lead him from the truths of the Gospel, without which our

<div class="center">LETTER TO C. HUNTLY GORDON, ESQ. Rydal Mount, July 29. 1829.</div>

<p>MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>I hope you have enjoyed yourself in the country, as we have been doing
among our shady woods, and green hills, and invigorated streams. The
summer is passing on, and I have not left home, and perhaps shall not;
for it is far more from duty than inclination that I quit my dear and
beautiful home; and duty pulls two ways. On the one side my mind stands
in need of being fed by new objects for meditation and reflection, the
more so because diseased eyes have cut me off so much from reading; and,
on the other hand, I am obliged to look at the expense of distant
travelling, as I am not able to take so much out of my body by walking
as heretofore.</p>

<p>I have not got my MS. back from the &mdash;&mdash;,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> whose managers have,
between them, used me shamefully; but my complaint is principally of the
editor, for with the proprietor I have had little direct connection. If
you think it worth while, you shall, at some future day, see such parts
of the correspondence as I have preserved. Mr. Southey is pretty much in
the same predicament with them, though he has kept silence for the
present.... I am properly served for having had any connection with such
things. My only excuse is, that they offered me a very liberal sum, and
that I have laboured hard through a long life, without more pecuniary
emolument than a lawyer gets for two special retainers, or a public
performer sometimes for two or three songs. Farewell; pray let me hear
from 3-011 at your early convenience,</p>

<p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Kendal, Oct. 16. 1829.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>On my return from Ireland, where I have been travelling a few weeks, I
found your present of George Peele's<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>{299}</span> works, and the obliging letter
accompanying it; for both of which I offer my cordial thanks.</p>

<p>English literature is greatly indebted to your labours; and I have much
pleasure in this occasion of testifying my respect for the sound
judgment and conscientious diligence with which you discharge your duty
as an editor. Peele's works were well deserving of the care you have
bestowed upon them; and, as I did not previously possess a copy of any
part of them, the beautiful book which you have sent me was very
acceptable.</p>

<p>By accident, I learned lately that you had made a Book of Extracts,
which I had long wished for opportunity and industry to execute myself.
I am happy it has fallen into so much better hands. I allude to your
<i>Selections from the Poetry of English Ladies</i>. I had only a glance at
your work; but I will take this opportunity of saying, that should a
second edition be called for, I should be pleased with the honour of
being consulted by you about it. There is one poetess to whose writings
I am especially partial, the Countess of Winchelsea. I have perused her
poems frequently, and should be happy to name such passages as I think
most characteristic of her genius, and most fit to be selected.</p>

<p>I know not what to say about my intended edition of a portion of
Thomson. There appears to be some indelicacy in one poet treating
another in that way. The example is not good, though I think there are
few to whom the process might be more advantageously applied than to
Thomson. Yet, so sensible am I of the objection, that I should not have
entertained the thought, but for the expectation held out to me by an
acquaintance, that valuable materials for a new Life of Thomson might be
procured. In this I was disappointed.</p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">With much respect, I remain, dear Sir,</span><br />

<h3><a name="letter65" id="letter65" ></a>65. <i>Of Lady Winchelsea, Tickell, &amp;c.: Sonnets, &amp;c.</i></h3>

<div class="center">LETTER TO REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Kendal, May 10. 1830.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>My last was, for want of room, concluded so abruptly, that I avail
myself of an opportunity of sending you a few additional words free of
postage, upon the same subject.</p>

<p>I observed that Lady Winchelsea was unfortunate in her
models&mdash;<i>Pindarics</i> and <i>Fables</i>; nor does it appear from her
<i>Aristomenes</i> that she would have been more successful than her
contemporaries, if she had cultivated tragedy. She had sensibility
sufficient for the tender parts of dramatic writing, but in the stormy
and tumultuous she would probably have failed altogether. She seems to
have made it a moral and religious duty to control her feelings lest
they should mislead her. Of love, as a passion, she is afraid, no doubt
from a conscious inability to soften it down into friendship. I have
often applied two lines of her drama (p. 318) to her affections:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">'Love's soft bands,<br /></span>
<span>His gentle cords of hyacinths and roses,<br /></span>
<span>Wove in the dewy Spring when storms are silent.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By the by, in the next page are two impassioned lines spoken to a person
fainting:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Then let me hug and press thee into life,<br /></span>
<span>And lend thee motion from my beating heart.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From the style and versification of this, so much her longest work, I
conjecture that Lady Winchelsea had but a slender acquaintance with the
drama of the earlier part of the preceding century. Yet her style in
rhyme is often admirable, chaste, tender, and vigorous, and entirely
free from sparkle, antithesis, and that overculture, which reminds one,
by its broad glare, its stiffness, and heaviness, of the double daisies
of the garden, compared with their modest and sensitive kindred of the
fields. Perhaps I am mistaken, but I think there is a good deal of
resemblance in her style and versification to that of Tickell, to whom
Dr. Johnson justly assigns a high place among the minor poets, and of
whom Goldsmith rightly observes, that there is a strain of
ballad-thinking through all his poetry, and it is very attractive. Pope,
in that production of his boyhood, the 'Ode<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>{301}</span> to Solitude,' and in his
'Essay on Criticism,' has furnished proofs that at one period of his
life he felt the charm of a sober and subdued style, which he afterwards
abandoned for one that is, to my taste at least, too pointed and
ambitious, and for a versification too timidly balanced.</p>

<p>If a second edition of your 'Specimens' should be called for, you might
add from Helen Maria Williams the 'Sonnet to the Moon,' and that to
'Twilight;' and a few more from Charlotte Smith, particularly,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'I love thee, mournful, sober-suited Night.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the close of a sonnet of Miss Seward are two fine verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Come, that I may not hear the winds of night.<br /></span>
<span>Nor count the heavy eave-drops as they fall.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You have well characterised the poetic powers of this lady; but, after
all, her verses please me, with all their faults, better than those of
Mrs. Barbauld, who, with much higher powers of mind, was spoiled as a
poetess by being a dissenter, and concerned with a dissenting academy.
One of the most pleasing passages in her poetry is the close of the
lines upon 'Life,' written, I believe, when she was not less than eighty
years of age:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Life, we have been long together,' &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You have given a specimen of that ever-to-be-pitied victim of Swift,
'Vanessa.' I have somewhere a short piece of hers upon her passion for
Swift, which well deserves to be added. But I am becoming tedious, which
you will ascribe to a well-meant endeavour to make you some return for
your obliging attentions.</p>

<h3><a name="letter66" id="letter66" ></a>66. <i>Hamilton's 'Spirit of Beauty:' Verbal Criticism: Female Authorship: Words.</i></h3>

<p>Where there is so much sincerity of feeling in a matter so dignified as
the renunciation of poetry for science, one feels<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>{302}</span> that an apology is
necessary for verbal criticism. I will therefore content myself with
observing that 'joying' for joy or joyance is not to my taste. Indeed I
object to such liberties upon principle. We should soon have no language
at all if the unscrupulous coinage of the present day were allowed to
pass, and become a precedent for the future. One of the first duties of
a Writer is to ask himself whether his thought, feeling, or image cannot
be expressed by existing words or phrases, before he goes about creating
new terms, even when they are justified by the analogies of the
language. 'The cataract's steep flow' is both harsh and inaccurate:
'thou hast seen me bend over the cataract' would express one idea in
simplicity and all that was required. Had it been necessary to be more
particular, 'steep flow' are not the words that ought to have been used.
I remember Campbell says in a composition that is overrun with faulty
language, 'And dark as winter was the <i>flow</i> of Iser rolling rapidly;'
that is, 'flowing rapidly.' The expression ought to have been 'stream'
or 'current...' These may appear to you frigid criticisms, but depend
upon it no writings will live in which these rules are disregarded....</p>

<p>Female authorship is to be shunned as bringing in its train more and
heavier evils than have presented themselves to your sister's ingenuous
mind. No true friend I am sure will endeavour to shake her resolution to
remain in her own quiet and healthful obscurity. This is not said with a
view to discourage her from writing, nor have the remarks made above any
aim of the kind; they are rather intended to assist her in writing with
more permanent satisfaction to herself. She will probably write less in
proportion as she subjects her feelings to logical forms, but the range
of her sensibilities so far from being narrowed will extend as she
improves in the habit of looking at things thro' a steady light of
words; and, to speak a little metaphysically, words are not a mere
vehicle, but they are powers either to kill or animate.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>{303}</span></p>

<div class="center">TO CHARLES LAMB, ESQ.</div>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">Jan. 10. 1830.</span><br />
<p>MY DEAR LAMB,</p>

<p>A whole twelvemonth have I been a letter in your debt, for which fault I
have been sufficiently punished by self-reproach.</p>

<p>I liked your Play marvellously, having no objection to it but one, which
strikes me as applicable to a large majority of plays, those of
Shakspeare himself not entirely excepted&mdash;I mean a little degradation of
character for a more dramatic turn of plot. Your present of Hone's book
was very acceptable; and so much so, that your part of the book is the
cause why I did not write long ago. I wished to enter a little minutely
into notice of the dramatic extracts, and, on account of the smallness
of the print, deferred doing so till longer days would allow me to read
without candle-light, which I have long since given up. But, alas! when
the days lengthened, my eyesight departed, and for many months I could
not read three minutes at a time. You will be sorry to hear that this
infirmity still hangs about me, and almost cuts me off from reading
altogether. But how are you, and how is your dear sister? I long much,
as we all do, to know.</p>

<p>For ourselves, this last year, owing to my sister's dangerous illness,
the effects of which are not yet got over, has been an anxious one and
melancholy. But no more of this. My sister has probably told everything
about the family; so that I may conclude with less scruple, by assuring
you of my sincere and faithful affection for you and your dear sister.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, April 6. 1830.</span><br />
<br />
<p>MY DEAR MR. GORDON,</p>

<p>You are kind in noticing with thanks my rambling notes.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>We have had here a few days of delicious summer weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>{304}</span>It appeared with the suddenness of a pantomimic trick, stayed longer
than we had a right to expect, and was as rapidly succeeded by high
wind, bitter cold, and winter snow, over hill and dale.</p>

<p>I am not surprised that you are so well pleased with Mr. Quillinan. The
more you see of him the better you will like him. You ask what are my
employments. According to Dr. Johnson they are such as entitle me to
high commendation, for I am not only making two blades of grass grow
where only one grew before, but a dozen. In plain language, I am
draining a bit of spungy ground.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In the field where this goes on I

lakes, Rydal and Windermere, and more than two miles of intervening vale
with the stream visible by glimpses flowing through it. I shall have
great pleasure in showing you this among the other returns which I hope
one day to make for your kindness.</p>

<h3><a name="letter69" id="letter69" ></a>69. <i>Works of Webster, &amp;c.: Elder Poets: Dr. Darwin: 'Excursion:'
Collins, &amp;c.</i></h3>

<div class="center">LETTER TO REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.</div>

<span style="margin-left: 25em;">[No date, but Postmark, 1830.]</span>

<p>I am truly obliged, my dear Sir, by your valuable present of Webster's
Dramatic Works and the 'Specimens.'<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Your publisher was right in
insisting upon the whole of Webster, otherwise the book might have been
superseded, either by an entire edition separately given to the world,
or in some <i>corpus</i> of the dramatic writers. The poetic genius of
England, with the exception of Chaucer, Spenser, Milton, Dryden, Pope,
and a very few more, is to be sought in her drama. How it grieves one
that there is so little probability of those valuable authors being read
except by the curious! I questioned my friend Charles Lamb whether it
would answer for some person of real taste to undertake abridging the
plays that are not likely to be read as wholes, and telling such parts
of the story in brief abstract as were ill managed in the drama. He
thought it would not. I, however, am inclined to think it would.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>{305}</span>The account of your indisposition gives me much concern. It pleases me,
however, to see that, though you may suffer, your industry does not
relax; and I hope that your pursuits are rather friendly than injurious
to your health.</p>

<p>You are quite correct in your notice of my obligation to Dr.
Darwin.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In the first edition of the poem it was acknowledged in a
note, which slipped out of its place in the last, along with some
others. In putting together that edition, I was obliged to cut up
several copies; and, as several of the poems also changed their places,
some confusion and omission, and, in one instance, a repetition, was the
consequence. Nothing, however, so bad as in the edition of 1820, where a
long poem, 'The Lament of Mary Queen of Scots,' was by mistake
altogether omitted. Another unpleasantness arose from the same cause;
for, in some instances, notwithstanding repeated charges to the printer,
you have only two Spenserian stanzas in a page (I speak now of the last
edition) instead of three; and there is the same irregularity in
printing other forms of stanza.</p>

<p>You must indeed have been fond of that ponderous quarto, 'The
Excursion,' to lug it about as you did.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> In the edition of 1827 it
was diligently revised, and the sense in several instances got into less
room; yet still it is a long poem for these feeble and fastidious times.
You would honour me much by accepting a copy of my poetical works; but I
think it better to defer offering it to you till a new edition is called
for, which will be ere long, as I understand the present is getting low.</p>

<p>A word or two about Collins. You know what importance I attach to
following strictly the last copy of the text of an author; and I do not
blame you for printing in the 'Ode to Evening' 'brawling' spring; but
surely the epithet is most unsuitable to the time, the very worst, I
think, that could have been chosen.</p>

<p>I now come to Lady Winchelsea. First, however, let me say a few words
upon one or two other authoresses of your 'Specimens.' British poetesses
make but a poor figure in the 'Poems by Eminent Ladies.'<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>But observing how injudicious that selection is in the case of Lady
Winchelsea, and of Mrs. Aphra Behn (from whose attempts they are
miserably copious),<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>{306}</span> I have thought something better might have been
chosen by more competent persons who had access to the volumes of the
several writers. In selecting from Mrs. Pilkington, I regret that you
omitted (look at p. 255) 'Sorrow,' or at least that you did not abridge
it. The first and third paragraph are very affecting. See also
'Expostulation,' p. 258: it reminds me strongly of one of the
Penitential Hymns of Burns. The few lines upon St. John the Baptist, by
Mrs. Killigrew (vol. ii. p. 6), are pleasing. A beautiful Elegy of Miss
Warton (sister to the poets of that name) upon the death of her father,
has escaped your notice; nor can I refer you to it. Has the Duchess of
Newcastle written much verse? her Life of her Lord, and the extracts in
your book, and in the 'Eminent Ladies,' are all that I have seen of
hers. The 'Mirth and Melancholy' has so many fine strokes of
imagination, that I cannot but think there must be merit in many parts
of her writings. How beautiful those lines, from 'I dwell in groves,' to
the conclusion, 'Yet better loved, the more that I am known,' excepting
the four verses after 'Walk up the hills.' And surely the latter verse
of the couplet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'The tolling bell which for the dead rings out;<br /></span>
<span>A mill where rushing waters run about;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is very noticeable: no person could have hit upon that union of images
without being possessed of true poetic feeling. Could you tell me
anything of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu more than is to be learned from
Pope's letters and her own? She seems to have been destined for
something much higher and better than she became. A parallel between her
genius and character and that of Lady Winchelsea her contemporary
(though somewhat prior to her) would be well worth drawing.</p>

<p>And now at last for the poems of Lady Winchelsea. I will transcribe a
note from a blank leaf of my own edition, written by me before I saw the
scanty notice of her in Walpole. (By the by, that book has always
disappointed me when I have consulted it upon any particular occasion.)
The note runs thus: 'The "Fragment," p. 280, seems to prove that she was
attached to James II., as does p. 42, and that she suffered by the
Revolution. The most celebrated of these poems, but far from the best,
is "The Spleen." "The Petition for an absolute Retreat," and the
"Nocturnal Reverie," are of much superior merit. See also for favourable
specimens, p. 156; "On the Death of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>{307}</span> Mr. Thynne," p. 263; and p. 280,
"Fragment." The Fable of "Love, Death, and Reputation," p. 29, is
ingeniously told.' Thus far my own note. I will now be more particular.
P. 3, 'Our Vanity,' &amp;c., and p. 163 are noticeable as giving some
account from herself of her authorship. See also p. 148, where she
alludes to 'The Spleen.' She was unlucky in her models, Pindaric Odes
and French Fables. But see p. 70, 'The Blindness of Elymas,' for proof
that she could write with powers of a high order when her own individual
character and personal feelings were not concerned. For less striking
proofs of this power, see p. 4, 'All is Vanity,' omitting verses 5 and
6, and reading 'clouds that are lost and gone,' &amp;c. There is merit in
the two next stanzas; and the last stanza towards the close contains a
fine reproof for the ostentation of Louis XIV., and one magnificent
verse,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Spent the astonished hours, forgetful to adore.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But my paper is nearly out. As far as 'For my garments,' p. 36, the poem
is charming; it then falls off; revives at p. 39, 'Give me there;' p.
41, &amp;c., reminds me of Dyer's 'Grongar Hill;' it revives p. 47, towards
the bottom, and concludes with sentiments worthy of the writer, though
not quite so happily expressed as other parts of the poem. See pages 82,
92, 'Whilst in the Muses' paths I stray;' p. 113. 'The Cautious Lovers,'
p. 118, has little poetic merit, but is worth reading as characteristic
of the author. P. 143, 'Deep lines of honour,' &amp;c., to 'maturer age.' P.
151, if shortened, would be striking; p. 154, characteristic; p. 159,
from 'Meanwhile, ye living parents,' to the close, omitting 'Nor could
we hope,' and the five following verses; p. 217, last paragraph; p. 259,
<i>that</i> you have;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> pp. 262, 263; p. 280, Was Lady W. a R. Catholic?
p. 290, 'And to the clouds proclaim thy fall;' p. 291, omit 'When
scatter'd glow-worms,' and the next couplet. I have no more room. Pray,
excuse this vile scrawl.</p>

<div class="center">LETTERS TO G. HUNTLY GORDON, ESQ.</div>

<p>MY DEAR MR. GORDON,</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I cannot but deeply regret that the late King of France and his
ministers should have been so infatuated. Their stupidity, not to say
their crimes, has given an impulse to the revolutionary and democratic
spirit throughout Europe which is premature, and from which much
immediate evil may be apprehended, whatever things may settle into at
last. Whereas had the Government conformed to the increasing knowledge
of the people, and not surrendered itself to the counsels of the priests
and the bigoted Royalists, things might have been kept in an even
course, to the mutual improvement and benefit of both governed and
governors.</p>

<p>In France incompatible things are aimed at&mdash;a monarchy and democracy to
be united without an intervening aristocracy to constitute a graduated
scale of power and influence. I cannot conceive how an hereditary
monarchy can exist without an hereditary peerage in a country so large
as France, nor how either can maintain their ground if the law of the
Napoleon Code, compelling equal division of property by will, be not
repealed. And I understand that a vast majority of the French are
decidedly adverse to the repeal of that law, which, I cannot but think,
will ere long be found injurious both to France and, in its collateral
effects, to the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">Ever, dear Mr. Gordon,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Cordially and faithfully yours,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">WM. WORDSWORTH.</span><br />
</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>MY DEAR MR. GORDON,</p>

<p>Thanks for your hint about Rhenish: strength from wine is good, from
water still better.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>One is glad to see tyranny baffled and foolishness put to shame; but the
French King and his ministers will be unfairly judged by all those who
take not into consideration the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>{309}</span>difficulties of their position. It is
not to be doubted that there has long existed a determination, and that
plans have been laid, to destroy the Government which the French
received, as they felt, at the hands of the Allies, and their pride
could not bear. Moreover, the Constitution, had it been their own
choice, would by this time have lost favour in the eyes of the French,
as not sufficiently democratic for the high notion <i>that</i> people
entertain of their fitness to govern themselves; but, for my own part,
I'd rather fill the office of a parish beadle than sit on the throne
where the Duke of Orleans has suffered himself to be placed.</p>

<p>The heat is gone, and but that we have too much rain again the country
would be enchanting.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">With a thousand thanks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">I remain ever yours,</span><br />

<div class="center">LETTERS TO PROFESSOR HAMILTON.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Trinity Lodge, Cambridge, November 26. 1830.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR MR. HAMILTON,<br />
</p>

<p>I reached this place nine days ago, where I should have found your
letter of the 23d ult., but that it had been forwarded to Coleorton
Hall, Leicestershire, where we stopped a week on our road. I am truly
glad to find that your good spirits put you upon writing what you call
nonsense, and so much of it; but I assure you it all passed with me for
very agreeable sense, or something better, and continues to do so even
in this learned spot; which you will not be surprised to hear, when I
tell you that at a dinner-party the other day, I heard a Head of a
House, a clergyman also, gravely declare, that the rotten boroughs, as
they are called, should instantly be abolished without compensation to
their owners; that slavery should be destroyed with like disregard of
the <i>claims</i> (for rights he would allow none) of the proprietors, and a
multitude of extravagances of the same sort. Therefore say I, Vive la
Bagatelle; motley is your only wear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>{310}</span></p>

<p>You tell me kindly that you have often asked yourself where is Mr.
Wordsworth, and the question has readily been solved for you. He is at
Cambridge: a great mistake! So late as the 5th of November, I will tell
you where I was, a solitary equestrian entering the romantic little town
of Ashford in the Waters, on the edge of Wilds of Derbyshire, at the
close of day, when guns were beginning to be left [let?] off and squibs
to be fired on every side. So that I thought it prudent to dismount and
lead my horse through the place, and so on to Bakewell, two miles
farther. You must know how I happened to be riding through these wild
regions. It was my wish that Dora should have the benefit of her pony
while at Cambridge, and very valiantly and economically I determined,
unused as I am to horsemanship, to ride the creature myself. I sent
James with it to Lancaster; there mounted; stopped a day at Manchester,
a week at Coleorton, and so reached the end of my journey safe and
sound, not, however, without encountering two days of tempestuous rain.
Thirty-seven miles did I ride in one day through the worse of these
storms. And what was my resource? guess again: writing verses to the
memory of my departed friend Sir George Beaumont, whose house I had left
the day before. While buffetting the other storm I composed a Sonnet
upon the splendid domain at Chatsworth, which I had seen in the morning,
as contrasted with the secluded habitations of the narrow dells in the
Park; and as I passed through the tame and manufacture-disfigured
country of Lancashire I was reminded by the faded leaves, of Spring, and
threw off a few stanzas of an ode to May.</p>

<p>But too much of self and my own performances upon my steed&mdash;a descendant
no doubt of Pegasus, though his owner and present rider knew nothing of
it. Now for a word about Professor Airey. I have seen him twice; but I
did not communicate your message. It was at dinner and at an evening
party, and I thought it best not to speak of it till I saw him, which I
mean to do, upon a morning call.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of intellectual activity within the walls of this
College, and in the University at large; but conversation turns mainly
upon the state of the country and the late change in the administration.
The fires have extended to within 8 miles of this place; from which I
saw one of the worst, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>{311}</span> absolutely the worst, indicated by a
redness in the sky&mdash;a few nights ago.</p>

<p>I am glad when I fall in with a member of Parliament, as it puts me upon
writing to my friends, which I am always disposed to defer, without such
a determining advantage. At present we have two members, Mr. Cavendish,
one of the representatives of the University, and Lord Morpeth, under
the Master's roof. We have also here Lady Blanche, wife of Mr.
Cavendish, and sister of Lord Morpeth. She is a great admirer of Mrs.
Hemans' poetry. There is an interesting person in this University for a
day or two, whom I have not yet seen&mdash;Kenelm Digby, author of the
'Broadstone of Honor,' a book of chivalry, which I think was put into
your hands at Rydal Mount. We have also a respectable show of blossom in
poetry. Two brothers of the name of Tennison, in particular, are not a
little promising. Of science I can give you no account; though perhaps I
may pick up something for a future letter, which may be long in coming
for reasons before mentioned. Mrs. W. and my daughter, of whom you
inquire, are both well; the latter rides as often as weather and regard
for the age of her pony will allow. She has resumed her German labours,
and is not easily drawn from what she takes to. Therefore I hope Miss
Hamilton will not find fault if she does not write for some time, as she
will readily conceive that with this passion upon her, and many
engagements, she will be rather averse to writing. In fact she owes a
long letter to her brother in Germany, who, by the bye, tells us that he
will not cease to look out for the Book of Kant you wished for.
Farewell, with a thousand kind remembrances to yourself and sister, and
the rest of your amiable family, in which Mrs. W. and Dora join.</p>

Revisited.'</i></h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Oct. 27 [1831].</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR MR. HAMILTON,<br />
</p>

<p>A day or two before my return from Scotland arrived your letter and
verses; for both of which I thank you, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>{312}</span> exhibit your mind under
those varied phases which I have great pleasure in contemplating. My
reply is earlier than it would have been, but for the opportunity of a
frank from one of the Members for the University of Oxford&mdash;a friend of
Mr. Southey's and mine, who by way of recreating himself after the
fatigues of the last Session, had taken a trip to see the Manchester
railway, and kindly and most unexpectedly came on to give a day apiece
to Southey and me. He is, like myself, in poor heart at the aspect of
public affairs. In his opinion the Ministers when they brought in the
Bill neither expected nor wished it to be carried. All they wanted was
an opportunity of saying to the people, 'Behold what great things we
would have done for you had it been in our power: we must now content
ourselves with the best we can get.' But, to return to your letter. To
speak frankly, you appear to be at least three-fourths gone in love;
therefore, think about the last quarter in the journey. The picture you
give of the lady makes one wish to see her more familiarly than I had an
opportunity of doing, were it only to ascertain whether, as you
astronomers have in your observatories magnifying glasses for the stars,
you do not carry about with you also, when you descend to common life,
coloured glasses and Claude Loraine mirrors for throwing upon objects
that interest you enough for the purpose, such lights and hues as may be
most to the taste of the intellectual vision. In a former letter you
mention Francis Edgeworth. He is a person not to be forgotten. If you be
in communication with him pray present him my very kind respects, and
say that he was not unfrequently in my thoughts during my late poetic
rambles; and particularly when I saw the objects which called forth a
Sonnet that I shall send you. He was struck with my mention of a sound
in the eagle's notes, much and frequently resembling the yelping and
barking of a dog, and quoted a passage in Eschylus where the eagle is
called the flying hound of the air, and he suggested that Eschylus might
not only allude by that term to his being a bird of chase or prey, but
also to this barking voice, which I do not recollect ever hearing
noticed. The other day I was forcibly reminded of the circumstances
under which the pair of eagles were seen that I described in the letter
to Mr. Edgeworth, his brother. It was the promontory of Fairhead, on the
coast of Antrim, and no spectacle could be grander. At Dunally Castle, a
ruin seated at the tip<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>{313}</span> of one of the horns of the bay of Oban, I saw
the other day one of these noble creatures cooped up among the ruins,
and was incited to give vent to my feelings as you shall now see:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Dishonoured Rock and Ruin! that by law<br /></span>
<span>Tyrannic, keep the Bird of Jove imbarred,<br /></span>
<span>Like a lone criminal whose life is spared.<br /></span>
<span>Vexed is he and screams loud:&mdash;The last I saw<br /></span>
<span>Was on the wing, and struck my soul with awe,<br /></span>
<span>Now wheeling low, then with a consort paired,<br /></span>
<span>From a bold headland their loved aery's guard,<br /></span>
<span>Flying, above Atlantic waves,&mdash;to draw<br /></span>
<span>Light from the fountain of the setting sun.<br /></span>
<span>Such was this prisoner once; and, when his plumes<br /></span>
<span>The sea-blast ruffles as the storm comes on,<br /></span>
<span>In spirit, for a moment he resumes<br /></span>
<span>His rank 'mong free-born creatures that live free;<br /></span>
<span>His power, his beauty, and his majesty.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You will naturally wish to hear something of Sir Walter Scott, and
particularly of his health. I found him a good deal changed within the
last three or four years, in consequence of some shocks of the
apoplectic kind; but his friends say that he is very much better, and
the last accounts, up to the time of his going on board, were still more
favourable. He himself thinks his age much against him, but he has only
completed his 60th year. But a friend of mine was here the other day,
who has rallied, and is himself again, after a much severer shock, and
at an age several years more advanced. So that I trust the world and his
friends may be hopeful, with good reason, that the life and faculties of
this man, who has during the last six and twenty years diffused more
innocent pleasure than ever fell to the lot of any human being to do in
his own life-time, may be spared. Voltaire, no doubt, was full as
extensively known, and filled a larger space probably in the eye of
Europe; for he was a great theatrical writer, which Scott has not proved
himself to be, and miscellaneous to that degree, that there was
something for all classes of readers: but the pleasure afforded by his
writings, with the exception of some of his Tragedies and minor Poems,
was not pure, and in this Scott is greatly his superior.</p>

<p>As Dora has told your sister, Sir W. was our guide to Yarrow. The
pleasure of that day induced me to add a third to the two poems upon
Yarrow, 'Yarrow Revisited.' It is in the same measure, and as much in
the same spirit as matter of fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>{314}</span> would allow. You are artist enough to
know that it is next to impossible entirely to harmonise things that
rest upon their poetic credibility, and are idealised by distance of
time and space, with those that rest upon the evidence of the hour, and
have about them the thorny points of actual life. I am interrupted by a
stranger, and a gleam of fine weather reminds me also of taking
advantage of it the moment I am at liberty, for we have had a week of
incessant rain.</p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO LADY FREDERICK BENTINCK.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Nov. 9.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR LADY FREDERICK,<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You are quite right, dear Lady F., in congratulating me on my late
ramble in Scotland. I set off with a severe inflammation in one of my
eyes, which was removed by being so much in the open air; and for more
than a month I scarcely saw a newspaper, or heard of their contents.
During this time we almost forgot, my daughter and I, the deplorable
state of the country. My spirits rallied, and, with exercise&mdash;for I
often walked scarcely less than twenty miles a day&mdash;and the employment
of composing verses, amid scenery the most beautiful, and at a season
when the foliage was most rich and varied, the time flew away
delightfully; and when we came back into the world again, it seemed as
if I had waked from a dream, that never was to return. We travelled in
an open carriage with one horse, driven by Dora; and while we were in
the Highlands I walked most of the way by the side of the carriage,
which left us leisure to observe the beautiful appearances. The rainbows
and coloured mists floating about the hills were more like enchantment
than anything I ever saw, even among the Alps. There was in particular,
the day we made the tour of Loch Lomond in the steamboat, a fragment of
a rainbow, so broad, so splendid, so glorious, with its reflection in
the calm water, it astonished every one on board, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>{315}</span> party of foreigners
especially, who could not refrain from expressing their pleasure in a
more lively manner than we are accustomed to do. My object in going to
Scotland so late in the season was to see Sir Walter Scott before his
departure. We stayed with him three days, and he quitted Abbotsford the
day after we left it. His health has undoubtedly been much shattered, by
successive shocks of apoplexy, but his friends say he is so much
recovered, that they entertain good hopes of his life and faculties
being spared. Mr. Lockhart tells me that he derived benefit by a change
of his treatment made by his London physicians, and that he embarked in
good spirits.</p>

<p>As to public affairs, I have no hope but in the goodness of Almighty
God. The Lords have recovered much of the credit they had lost by their
conduct in the Roman Catholic question. As an Englishman I am deeply
grateful for the stand which they have made, but I cannot help fearing
that they may be seduced or intimidated. Our misfortune is, that the
disapprovers of this monstrous bill give way to a belief that nothing
can prevent its being passed; and therefore they submit.</p>

<p>As to the cholera, I cannot say it appals me much; it may be in the
order of Providence to employ this scourge for bringing the nation to
its senses; though history tells us in the case of the plague at Athens,
and other like visitations, that men are never so wicked and depraved as
when afflictions of that kind are upon them. So that, after all, one
must come round to our only support, submission to the will of God, and
faith in the ultimate goodness of His dispensations.</p>

<p>I am sorry you did not mention your son, in whose health and welfare,
and progress in his studies, I am always much interested. Pray remember
me kindly to Lady Caroline. All here join with me in presenting their
kindest remembrances to yourself; and believe me, dear Lady Frederick,</p>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Aug. 20. 1833.</span>

<p>The visit which occasioned the poem ['Yarrow Revisited'] addressed to
Sir Walter Scott, that you mention in terms so flattering, was a very
melancholy one. My daughter was with me. We arrived at his house on
Monday noon, and left it at the same time on Thursday, the very day
before he quitted Abbotsford for London, on his way to Naples. On the
morning of our departure he composed a few lines for Dora's Album, and
wrote them in it. We prize this memorial very much, and the more so as
an affecting testimony of his regard at a time when, as the verses
prove, his health of body and powers of mind were much impaired and
shaken. You will recollect the little green book which you were kind
enough to write in on its first page.</p>

<p>Let me hope that your health will improve, so that you may be enabled to
proceed with the sacred poetry with which you are engaged. Be assured

<p>

<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>You have imputed my silence, I trust, to some cause neither disagreeable
to yourself nor unworthy of me. Your letter of the 26th of Nov. had been
misdirected to Penrith, where the postmaster detained it some time,
expecting probably that I should come to that place, which I have often
occasion to visit. When it reached me I was engaged in assisting my wife
to make out some of my mangled and almost illegible MSS., which
inevitably involved me in endeavours to correct and improve them. My
eyes are subject to frequent inflammations, of which I had an attack
(and am still suffering from it) while that was going on. You would
nevertheless have heard from me almost as soon as I received your
letter, could I have replied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>{317}</span> it in terms in any degree accordant to
my wishes. Your exhortations troubled me in a way you cannot be in the
least aware of; for I have been repeatedly urged by some of my most
valued friends, and at times by my own conscience, to undertake the task
you have set before me. But I will deal frankly with you. A conviction
of my incompetence to do justice to the momentous subject has kept me,
and I fear will keep me, silent. My sixty-second year will soon be
completed, and though I have been favoured thus far in health and
strength beyond most men of my age, yet I feel its effects upon my
spirits; they sink under a pressure of apprehension to which, at an
earlier period of my life, they would probably have been superior. There
is yet another obstacle: I am no ready master of prose writing, having
been little practised in the art. This last consideration will not weigh
with you; nor would it have done with myself a few years ago; but the
bare mention of it will serve to show that years have deprived me of
<i>courage</i>, in the sense the word bears when applied by Chaucer to the
animation of birds in spring time.</p>

<p>What I have already said precludes the necessity of otherwise confirming
your assumption that I am opposed to the spirit you so justly
characterise.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> To your opinions upon this subject, my judgment (if I
may borrow your own word) 'responds.' Providence is now trying this
empire through her political institutions. Sound minds find their
expediency in principles; unsound, their principles in expediency. On
the proportion of these minds to each other the issue depends. From
calculations of partial expediency in opposition to general principles,
whether those calculations be governed by fear or presumption, nothing
but mischief is to be looked for; but, in the present stage of our
affairs, the class that does the most harm consists <i>of
well-intentioned</i> men, who, being ignorant of human nature, think that
they may help the thorough-paced reformers and revolutionists to a
<i>certain</i> point, then stop, and that the machine will stop with them.
After all, the question is, fundamentally, one of piety and morals; of
piety, as disposing men who are anxious for social improvement to wait
patiently for God's good time; and of morals, as guarding them from
doing evil that good may come, or thinking that any ends <i>can</i> be so
good as to justify<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>{318}</span> wrong means for attaining them. In fact, means, in
the concerns of this life, are infinitely more important than ends,
which are to be valued mainly according to the qualities and virtues
requisite for their attainment; and the best test of an end being good
is the purity of the means, which, by the laws of God and our nature,
must be employed in order to secure it. Even the interests of eternity
become distorted the moment they are looked at through the medium of
impure means. Scarcely had I written this, when I was told by a person
in the Treasury, that it is intended to carry the Reform Bill by a new
creation of peers. If this be done, the constitution of England will be
destroyed, and the present Lord Chancellor, after having contributed to
murder it, may consistently enough pronounce, in his place, its <i>&eacute;loge
fun&egrave;bre</i>!</p>

<p>I turn with pleasure to the sonnets you have addressed to me and if I
did not read them with unqualified satisfaction it was only from
consciousness that I was unworthy of the enconiums they bestowed upon
me.</p>

<p>Among the papers I have lately been arranging are passages that would
prove as forcibly as anything of mine that has been published, you were
not mistaken in your supposition that it is the habit of my mind
inseparably to connect loftiness of imagination with that humility of
mind which is best taught in Scripture.</p>

<p>Hoping that you will be indulgent to my silence, which has been, from
various causes, protracted contrary to my wish,</p>

<p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO PROFESSOR HAMILTON, DUBLIN.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">Nov. 22. 1831.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR MR. HAMILTON,<br />
</p>

<p>You send me showers of verses, which I receive with much pleasure, as do
we all; yet have we fears that this employment may seduce you from the
path of Science, which you seem destined to tread with so much honour to
yourself and profit to others. Again and again I must repeat, that the
composition<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>{319}</span> of verse is infinitely more of an art than men are prepared
to believe; and absolute success in it depends upon innumerable
minutiae, which it grieves me you should stoop to acquire a knowledge
of. Milton talks of 'pouring easy his unpremeditated verse.' It would be
harsh, untrue, and odious, to say there is anything like cant in this;
but it is not true to the letter, and tends to mislead. I could point
out to you five hundred passages in Milton upon which labour has been
bestowed, and twice five hundred more to which additional labour would
have been serviceable. Not that I regret the absence of such labour,
because no poem contains more proofs of skill acquired by practice.
These observations are not called out by any defects or imperfections in
your last pieces especially: they are equal to the former ones in
effect, have many beauties, and are not inferior in execution; but again
I do venture to submit to your consideration, whether the poetical parts
of your nature would not find a field more favourable to their exercise
in the regions of prose: not because those regions are humbler, but
because they may be gracefully and profitably trod with footsteps less
careful and in measures less elaborate. And now I have done with the
subject, and have only to add, that when you write verses you would not
fail, from time to time, to let me have a sight of them; provided you
will allow me to defer criticism on your diction and versification till
we meet. My eyes are so often useless both for reading and writing, that
I cannot tax the eyes and pens of others with writing down observations
which to indifferent persons must be tedious.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, I am not sorry that your project of going to London at
present is dropped. It would have grieved me had you been unfurnished
with an introduction from me to Mr. Coleridge; yet I know not how I
could have given you one&mdash;he is often so very unwell. A few weeks ago he
had had two attacks of cholera, and appears to be so much broken down
that unless I were assured he was something in his better way I could
not disturb him by the introduction of any one. His most intimate friend
is Mr. Green, a man of science and a distinguished surgeon. If to him
you could procure an introduction he would let you know the state of
Coleridge's health; and to Mr. Green, whom I once saw, you might use my
name with a view to further your wish, if it were at all needful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>{320}</span></p>

<p>Shakspeare's sonnets (excuse this leap) are not upon the Italian model,
which Milton's are; they are merely quatrains with a couplet tacked to
the end; and if they depended much upon the versification they would
unavoidably be heavy.</p>

<p>One word upon Reform in Parliament, a subject to which, somewhat
reluctantly, you allude. You are a Reformer! Are you an approver of the
Bill as rejected by the Lords? or, to use Lord Grey's words, anything
'as efficient?'&mdash;he means, if he means anything, for producing change.
Then I earnestly entreat you to devote hours and hours to the study of
human nature, in books, in life, and in your own mind; and beg and pray
that you would mix with society, not in Ireland and Scotland only, but
in England; a fount of destiny which, if once poisoned, away goes all
hope of quiet progress in well doing. The constitution of England, which
seems about to be destroyed, offers to my mind the sublimest
contemplation which the history of society and government have ever
presented to it; and for this cause especially, that its principles have
the character of preconceived ideas, archetypes of the pure intellect,
while they are, in fact, the results of a humble-minded experience.
Think about this, apply it to what we are threatened with, and farewell.</p>

<div class="center">EXTRACT OF LETTER TO LADY FREDERICK BENTINCK.</div>

<p>You were not mistaken in supposing that the state of public affairs has
troubled me much. I cannot see how the government is to be carried on,
but by such sacrifices to the democracy as will, sooner or later, upset
everything. Whoever governs, it will be by out-bidding for popular
favour those who went before them. Sir Robert Peel was obliged to give
way in his government to the spirit of Reform, as it is falsely called;
these men are going beyond him; and if ever he shall come back, it will
only, I fear, be to carry on the movement, in a shape somewhat less
objectionable than it will take from the Whigs. In the mean while the
Radicals or Republicans are cunningly content to have this work done
ostensibly by the Whigs, while in fact they themselves are the Whigs'
masters, as the Whigs well know; but they hope to be preserved from
destruction by throwing themselves back upon the Tories when measures
shall be urged upon them by their masters which they may think too
desperate. What I am most afraid of is, alterations in the constituency,
and in the duration of Parliament, which will bring it more and more
under the dominion of the lower and lowest classes. On this account I
fear the proposed Corporation Reform, as a step towards household
suffrage, vote by ballot, &amp;c. As to a union of the Tories and Whigs in
Parliament, I see no prospect of it whatever. To the great Whig lords
may be truly applied the expression in <i>Macbeth</i>,</p>

MY DEAR BROTHER,<br />
</p>

<p>Our dear sister makes no progress towards recovery of strength. She is
very feeble, never quits her room, and passes most of the day in, or
upon, the bed. She does not suffer much pain, and is very cheerful, and
nothing troubles her but public affairs and the sense of requiring so
much attention. Whatever may be the close of this illness, it will be a
profound consolation to you, my dear brother, and to us all, that it is
borne with perfect resignation; and that her thoughts are such as the
good and pious would wish. She reads much, both religious and
miscellaneous works.</p>

<p>If you see Mr. Watson, remember me affectionately to him.</p>

<p>I was so distressed with the aspect of public affairs, that were it not
for our dear sister's illness, I should think of nothing else. They are
to be envied, I think, who, from age or infirmity, are likely to be
removed from the afflictions which God is preparing for this sinful
nation. God bless you, my brother. John says you are well; so am I, and
every one here except our sister: but I have witnessed one revolution in
a foreign country, and I have not courage to think of facing another in
my own. Farewell. God bless you again.</p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO PROFESSOR HAMILTON, DUBLIN.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Moresby, June 25. 1832.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR MR. HAMILTON,<br />
</p>

<p>Your former letter reached me in due time; your second, from Cambridge,
two or three days ago. I ought to have written to you long since, but
really I have for some time, from private and public causes of sorrow
and apprehension, been in a great measure deprived of those genial
feelings which, thro'<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>{323}</span> life, have not been so much accompaniments of my
character, as vital principles of my existence.</p>

<p>My dear sister has been languishing more than seven months in a
sick-room, nor dare I or any of her friends entertain a hope that her
strength will ever be restored; and the course of public affairs, as I
think I told you before, threatens, in my view, destruction to the
institutions of the country; an event which, whatever may rise out of it
hereafter, cannot but produce distress and misery for two or three
generations at least. In any times I am but at best a poor and
unpunctual correspondent, yet I am pretty sure you would have heard from
me but for this reason; therefore let the statement pass for an apology
as far as you think fit.</p>

<p>The verses called forth by your love and the disappointment that
followed I have read with much pleasure, tho' grieved that you should
have suffered so much; as poetry they derive an interest from your
philosophical pursuits, which could not but recommend the verses even to
indifferent readers, and must give them in the eyes of your friends a
great charm. The style appears to me good, and the general flow of the
versification harmonious; but you deal somewhat more in dactylic endings
and identical terminations than I am accustomed to think legitimate.
Sincerely do I congratulate you upon being able to continue your
philosophical pursuits under such a pressure of personal feeling.</p>

<p>It gives me much pleasure that you and Coleridge have met, and that you
were not disappointed in the conversation of a man from whose writings
you had previously drawn so much delight and improvement. He and my
beloved sister are the two beings to whom my intellect is most indebted,
and they are now proceeding, as it were, <i>pari passu</i>, along the path of
sickness, I will not say towards the grave, but I trust towards a
blessed immortality.</p>

<p>It was not my intention to write so seriously: my heart is full, and you
must excuse it.</p>

<p>You do not tell me how you like Cambridge as a place, nor what you
thought of its buildings and other works of art. Did you not see Oxford
as well? Surely you would not lose the opportunity; it has greatly the
advantage over Cambridge in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>{324}</span> its happy intermixture of streets,
churches, and collegiate buildings.</p>

<p>I hope you found time when in London to visit the British Museum.</p>

<p>A fortnight ago I came hither to my son and daughter, who are living a
gentle, happy, quiet, and useful life together. My daughter Dora is also
with us. On this day I should have returned, but an inflammation in my
eyes makes it unsafe for me to venture in an open carriage, the weather
being exceedingly disturbed.</p>

<p>A week ago appeared here Mr. W.S. Landor, the Poet, and author of the
<i>Imaginary Conversations</i>, which probably have fallen in your way. We
had never met before, tho' several letters had passed between us; and as
I had not heard that he was in England, my gratification in seeing him
was heightened by surprise. We passed a day together at the house of my
friend Mr. Rawson, on the banks of Wastwater. His conversation is lively
and original; his learning great, tho' he will not allow it, and his
laugh the heartiest I have heard of a long time. It is not much less
than twenty years since he left England for France, and afterwards
Italy, where he hopes to end his days, nay [he has] fixed near Florence
upon the spot where he wishes to be buried. Remember me most kindly to
your sisters. Dora begs her love and thanks to your sister Eliza for her
last most interesting letter, which she will answer when she can command
a frank.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Nov. 22 [1832].</span><br />
<br />
DEAR MRS. HEMANS,<br />
</p>

<p>I will not render this sheet more valueless than at best it will prove,
by tedious apologies for not answering your very kind and welcome letter
long and long ago. I received it in London, when my mind was in a most
uneasy state, and when my eyes were useless both for writing and
reading, so that an immediate reply was out of my power; and, since, I
have been doubtful where to address you. Accept this, and something
better, as my excuse, that I have very often thought of you with
kindness and good wishes for your welfare, and that of your fine boys,
who must recommend themselves to all that come in their way. Let me
thank you in Dora's name for your present of <i>The Remains of Lucretia
Davidson</i>, a very extraordinary young creature, of whom I had before
read some account in Mr. Southey's review of this volume. Surely many
things, not often bestowed, must concur to make genius an enviable gift.
This truth is painfully forced upon one's attention in reading the
effusions and story of this enthusiast, hurried to her grave so early.
You have, I understand, been a good deal in Dublin. The place I hope has
less of the fever of intellectual, or rather literary, ambition than
Edinburgh, and is less disquieted by factions and cabals of <i>persons</i>.
As to those of parties they must be odious and dreadful enough; but
since they have more to do with religion, the adherents of the different
creeds perhaps mingle little together, and so the mischief to social
intercourse, though great, will be somewhat less.</p>

<p>I am not sure but that Miss Jewsbury has judged well in her
determination of going to India. Europe is at present a melancholy
spectacle, and these two Islands are likely to reap the fruit of their
own folly and madness, in becoming, for the present generation, the two
most unquiet and miserable spots upon the earth. May you, my dear
friend, find the advantage of the poetic spirit in raising you, in
thought at least, above the contentious clouds! Never before did I feel
such reason to be grateful for what little inspiration heaven has
graciously be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>{326}</span>stowed upon my humble intellect. What you kindly wrote
upon the interest you took during your travels in my verses, could not
but be grateful to me, because your own show that in a rare degree you
understand and sympathise with me. We are all well, God be thanked. I am
a wretched correspondent, as this scrawl abundantly shows. I know also,
that you have far too much, both of receiving and writing letters, but I
cannot conclude without expressing a wish, that from time to time you
would let us hear from you and yours, and how you prosper. All join with
me in kindest remembrance to yourself and your boys, especially to
Charles, of whom we know most. Believe me, dear Mrs. Hemans, not the
less for my long silence,</p>

<p>MY DEAR C&mdash;&mdash;,</p>

<p>You are welcome to England after your long ramble. I know not what to
say in answer to your wish for my opinion upon the offer of the
lectureship.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have only one observation to make, to which I should attach importance
if I thought it called for in your case, which I do not. I mean the
moral duty of avoiding to encumber yourself with private pupils in any
number. You are at an age when the blossoms of the mind are setting, to
make fruit; and the practice of <i>pupil-mongering</i> is an absolute blight
for this process. Whatever determination you come to, may God grant that
it proves for your benefit: this prayer I utter with earnestness, being
deeply interested, my dear C&mdash;&mdash;, in all that concerns you. I have said
nothing of the uncertainty hanging over all the establishments,
especially the religious and literary ones of the country, because if
they are to be overturned, the calamity would be so widely spread, that
every mode of life would be involved in it, and nothing survive for
hopeful calculation.</p>

MY DEAR C&mdash;&mdash;,<br />
</p>

<p>You will wonder what is become of us, and I am afraid you will think me
very unworthy the trouble you took in writing to us and sending your
pamphlet. A thousand little things have occurred to prevent my calling
upon Mrs. Wordsworth, who is ever ready to write for me, in respect to
the question that you have so ably handled. Since the night when the
Reform Bill was first introduced, I have been convinced that the
institutions of the country cannot be preserved.... It is a mere
question <i>of time</i>. A great majority of the present parliament, I
believe, are in the main favourable to the preservation of the Church,
but among these many are ignorant how that is to be done. Add to the
portion of those who with good intentions are in the dark, the number
who will be driven or tempted to vote against their consciences by the
clamour of their sectarian and infidel constituents under the Reform
Bill, and you will have a daily augmenting power even in this
parliament, which will be more and more hostile to the Church every week
and every day. You will see from the course which my letter thus far has
taken, that I regard the prayer of the Petitioners to whom you are
opposed as formidable still more from the effect which, if granted, it
will ultimately have upon the Church, and through that medium upon the
Monarchy and upon social order, than for its immediate tendency to
introduce discord in the universities, and all those deplorable
consequences which you have so feelingly painted as preparatory to their
destruction.</p>

<p>I am not yet able to use my eyes for reading or writing, but your
pamphlet has been twice read to me....</p>

<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, March 20. 1833.</span><br />
<br />
<p>MY DEAR SIR,</p>
<p>
I have to thank you for the very valuable present of
Shirley's works, just received. The preface is all that I have
yet had time to read. It pleased me to find that you sympathised
with me in admiration of the passage from the Duchess
of Newcastle's poetry; and you will be gratified to be told that
I have the opinion you have expressed of that cold and false-hearted
Frenchified coxcomb, Horace Walpole.</p>

<p>Poor Shirley! what a melancholy end was his! and then to be so treated
by Dryden! One would almost suspect some private cause of dislike, such
as is said to, have influenced Swift in regard to Dryden himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>{329}</span></p>

<p>Shirley's death reminded me of a sad close of the life of a literary
person, Sanderson by name, in the neighbouring county of Cumberland. He
lived in a cottage by himself, though a man of some landed estate. His
cottage, from want of care on his part, took fire in the night. The
neighbours were alarmed; they ran to his rescue; he escaped, dreadfully
burned, from the flames, and lay down (he was in his seventieth year)
much exhausted under a tree, a few yards from the door. His friends, in
the meanwhile, endeavoured to save what they could of his property from
the flames. He inquired most anxiously after a box in which his
manuscripts and published pieces had been deposited with a view to a
publication of a laboriously-corrected edition; and, upon being told
that the box was consumed, he expired in a few minutes, saying, or
rather sighing out the words, 'Then I do not wish to live.' Poor man!
though the circulation of his works had not extended beyond a circle of
fifty miles' diameter, perhaps, at furthest, he was most anxious to
survive in the memory of the few who were likely to hear of him.</p>

<p>The publishing trade, I understand, continues to be much depressed, and
authors are driven to solicit or invite subscriptions, as being in many
cases the only means for giving their works to the world.</p>

<p>I am always pleased to hear from you; and believe me,</p>

<p>We look with anxiety to your sister Eliza's success in her schemes,&mdash;but
for pecuniary recompense in literature, especially poetical, nothing can
be more unpromising than the present state of affairs, except what we
have to fear for the future. Mrs. Godwyn, who sends verses to Blackwood,
is our neighbour. I have had no conversation with her myself upon the
subject, but a friend of hers says she has reason to believe that she
has got nothing but a present of books. This however is of no moment, as
Mrs. G. being a person of easy fortune she has not probably bargained
for a return in money. Mrs. Hemans I see continues to publish in the
periodicals. If you ever see her, pray remember me affectionately to
her, and tell her that I have often been, and still am, troubled in
conscience for having left her obliging letter so long unanswered; but
she must excuse me as there is not a motive in my mind urging me to
throw any interest into my letters to friends beyond the expression of
kindness and esteem; and <i>that</i> she does not require from me. Besides my
friends in general know how much I am hindered in all my pursuits by the
inflammation to which my eyes are so frequently subject. I have long
since given up all exercise of them by candle-light, and the evenings
and nights are the seasons when one is most disposed to converse in that
way with absent friends. News you do not care about, and I have none for
you, except what concerns friends. My sister, God be thanked, has had a
respite. She can now walk a few steps about her room, and has been borne
twice into the open air. Southey to whom I sent your Sonnets had, I
grieve to say, a severe attack of some unknown and painful complaint,
about ten days ago. It weakened him much, but he is now I believe
perfectly recovered. Coleridge I have reason to think is confined to his
bed; his mind vigorous as ever. Your Sonnets I think are as good as
anything you have done in verse. We like the 2d best; and I single it
out the more readily as it allows me an opportunity of reminding you of
what I have so often insisted upon, the extreme care which is necessary
in the composition of poetry.</p>

MY DEAR LAMB,<br />
</p>

<p>I have to thank you and Moxon for a delightful volume, your last (I hope
not) of 'Elia.' I have read it all except some of the 'Popular
Fallacies,' which I reserve.... The book has much pleased the whole of
my family, viz. my wife, daughter, Miss Hutchinson, and my poor dear
sister, on her sick bed; they all return their best thanks. I am not
sure but I like the 'Old China,' and the 'Wedding,' as well as any of
the Essays. I read 'Love me and my Dog' to my poor sister this morning.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have been thus particular, knowing how much you and your dear sister
value this excellent person, whose tenderness of heart I do not honestly
believe was ever exceeded by any of God's creatures. Her loving-kindness
has no bounds. God bless her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>{332}</span> for ever and ever! Again thanking you for
your excellent book, and wishing to know how you and your dear sister

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">[No date to this Letter, but written in 1833.]</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>The dedication<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> which you propose I shall esteem as an honour; nor
do I conceive upon what ground, but an over-scrupulous modesty, I could
object to it.</p>

<p>Be assured that Mr. Southey will not have the slightest unwillingness to
your making any use you think proper of his 'Memoir of Bampfylde:' I
shall not fail to mention the subject to him upon the first opportunity.</p>

<p>You propose to give specimens of the best <i>sonnet-writers</i> in our
language. May I ask if by this be meant a selection of the <i>best
sonnets, best</i> both as to <i>kind</i> and <i>degree</i>? A sonnet may be excellent
in its kind, but that kind of very inferior interest to one of a higher
order, though not perhaps in every minute particular quite so well
executed, and from the pen of a writer of inferior genius. It should
seem that the best rule to follow would be, first, to pitch upon the
sonnets which are best <i>both</i> in kind and perfectness of execution, and,
next, those which, although of a humbler quality, are admirable for the
finish and happiness of the execution, taking care to exclude all those
which have not one or other of these recommendations, however striking
they might be, as characteristic of the age in which the author lived,
or some peculiarity of his manner. The 10th sonnet of Donne, beginning
'Death, be not proud,' is so eminently characteristic of his manner, and
at the same time so weighty in the thought, and vigorous in the
expression, that I would entreat you to insert it, though to modern
taste it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>{333}</span> be repulsive, quaint, and laboured. There are two sonnets
of Russell, which, in all probability, you may have noticed, 'Could,
then, the babes,' and the one upon Philoctetes, the last six lines of
which are first-rate. Southey's 'Sonnet to Winter' pleases me much; but,
above all, among modern writers, that of Sir Egerton Brydges, upon 'Echo
and Silence.' Miss Williams's 'Sonnet upon Twilight' is pleasing; that
upon 'Hope' of great merit.</p>

<p>Do you mean to have a short preface upon the construction of the sonnet?
Though I have written so many, I have scarcely made up my own mind upon
the subject. It should seem that the sonnet, like every other legitimate
composition, ought to have a beginning, a middle, and an end; in other
words, to consist of three parts, like the three propositions of a
syllogism, if such an illustration may be used. But the frame of metre
adopted by the Italians does not accord with this view; and, as adhered
to by them, it seems to be, if not arbitrary, best fitted to a division
of the sense into two parts, of eight and six lines each. Milton,
however, has not submitted to this; in the better half of his sonnets
the sense does not close with the rhyme at the eighth line, but
overflows into the second portion of the metre. Now it has struck me
that this is not done merely to gratify the ear by variety and freedom
of sound, but also to aid in giving that pervading sense of intense
unity in which the excellence of the sonnet has always seemed to me
mainly to consist. Instead of looking at this composition as a piece of
architecture, making a whole out of three parts, I have been much in the
habit of preferring the image of an orbicular body,&mdash;a sphere, or a
dew-drop. All this will appear to you a little fanciful; and I am well
aware that a sonnet will often be found excellent, where the beginning,
the middle, and the end are distinctly marked, and also where it is
distinctly separated into <i>two</i> parts, to which, as I before observed,
the strict Italian model, as they write it, is favourable. Of this last
construction of sonnet, Russell's upon 'Philoctetes' is a fine specimen;
the first eight lines give the hardship of the case, the six last the
consolation, or the <i>per-contra</i>.</p>

<p>P.S. In the case of the Cumberland poet, I overlooked a most pathetic
circumstance. While he was lying under the tree, and his friends were
saving what they could from the flames, he desired them to bring out the
box that contained his papers, if possible. A person went back for it,
but the bottom dropped out, and the papers fell into the flames and were
consumed. Immediately upon hearing this, the poor old man expired.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<h3><a name="letter89" id="letter89" ></a>89. <i>The Poems of Lady Winchelsea, Skelton, &amp;c.</i></h3>

<div class="center">LETTER TO THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Lowther Castle, Sept. 23 [qu. Aug. 1833.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">No date of the Year.]</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>I have put off replying to your obliging letter till I could procure a
frank; as I had little more to say than to thank you for your attention
to Lady Winchelsea,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and for the extracts you sent me.</p>

<p>I expected to find at this place my friend, Lady Frederick Bentinck,
through whom I intended to renew my request for materials, if any exist,
among the Finch family, whether manuscript poems, or anything else that
would be interesting; but Lady F., unluckily, is not likely to be in
Westmoreland. I shall, however, write to her. Without some additional
materials, I think I should scarcely feel strong enough to venture upon
any species of publication connected with this very interesting woman,
notwithstanding the kind things you say of the value of my critical
remarks.</p>

<p>I am glad you have taken Skelton in hand, and much wish I could be of
any use to you. In regard to his life, I am certain of having read
somewhere (I thought it was in Burns's 'History of Cumberland and
Westmoreland,' but I am mistaken), that Skelton was born at Branthwaite
Hall, in the county of Cumberland. Certain it is that a family of that
name possessed the place for many generations; and I own it would give
me some pleasure to make out that Skelton was a brother Cumbrian.
Branthwaite Hall is about six miles from Cockermouth, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>{335}</span> native place.
Tickell (of the <i>Spectator</i>), one of the best of our minor poets, as
Johnson has truly said, was born within two miles of the same town.
These are mere accidents, it is true, but I am foolish enough to attach
some interest to them.</p>

<p>If it would be more agreeable to you, I would mention your views in
respect to Skelton to Mr. Southey: I should have done so before, but it
slipped my memory when I saw him. Mr. Southey is undoubtedly much
engaged, but I cannot think that he would take ill a letter from you on
any literary subject. At all events, I shall, in a few days, mention
your intention of editing Skelton, and ask if he has anything to
suggest.</p>

<p>I meditate a little tour in Scotland this autumn, my principal object
being to visit Sir Walter Scott; but as I take my daughter along with
me, we probably shall go to Edinburgh, Glasgow, and take a peep at the
western Highlands. This will not bring us near Aberdeen.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> If it
suited you to return to town by the Lakes, I should be truly glad to see
you at Rydal Mount, near Ambleside. You might, at all events, call on
Mr. Southey in your way; I would prepare an introduction for you, by
naming your intention to Mr. S. I have added this, because my Scotch
tour would, I fear, make it little likely that I should be at home about
the 10th September. Your return, however, may be deferred.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Believe me, my dear Sir,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Very respectfully, your obliged,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">W. WORDSWORTH.</span><br />
</p>

<p>P.S. I hope your health continues good. I assure you there was no want
of interest in your conversation on that or any other account.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

MY DEAR MR. MOXON,<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There does not appear to be much genuine relish for poetical
publications in Cumberland, if I may judge from the fact of not a copy
of my poems having been sold there by one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>{336}</span> the leading booksellers,
though Cumberland is my native county. Byron and Scott are, I am
persuaded, the only <i>popular</i> writers in that line,&mdash;perhaps the word
ought rather to be that they are <i>fashionable</i> writers.</p>

<p>My poor sister is something better in health. Pray remember me very
affectionately to Charles Lamb, and to his dear sister, if she be in a
state to receive such communications from her friends. I hope Mr. Rogers
is well; give my kindest regards to him also.</p>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Dec. 4. 1833.</span><br />

<p>MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>Your elegant volume of Sonnets,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> which you did me the honour to
dedicate to me, was received a few months after the date of the
accompanying letter; and the copy for Mr. Southey was forwarded
immediately, as you may have learned long ago, by a letter from himself.
Supposing you might not be returned from Scotland, I have deferred
offering my thanks for this mark of your attention: and about the time
when I should otherwise probably have written, I was seized with an
inflammation in my eyes, from the <i>effects</i> of which I am not yet so far
recovered as to make it prudent for me to use them in writing or
reading.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The selection of sonnets appears to me to be very judicious. If I were
inclined to make an exception, it would be in the single case of the
sonnet of Coleridge upon 'Schiller,' which is too much of a rant for my
taste. The one by him upon 'Linley's Music' is much superior in
execution; indeed, as a strain of feeling, and for unity of effect, it
is very happily done. I was glad to see Mr. Southey's 'Sonnet to
Winter.' A lyrical poem of my own, upon the disasters of the French army
in Russia, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>{337}</span> so striking a resemblance to it, in contemplating winter
under two aspects, that, in justice to Mr. Southey, who preceded me, I
ought to have acknowledged it in a note; and I shall do so upon some
future occasion.</p>

<p>How do you come on with Skelton? And is there any prospect of a new
edition of your <i>Specimens of British Poetesses</i>? If I could get at the
original works of the elder poetesses, such as the Duchess of Newcastle,
Mrs. Behn, Orinda, &amp;c., I should be happy to assist you with my judgment
in such a publication, which, I think, might be made still more
interesting than this first edition, especially if more matter were
crowded into a page. The two volumes of <i>Poems by Eminent Ladies</i>, Helen
Maria Williams's works, Mrs. Smith's Sonnets, and Lady Winchelsea's
Poems, form the scanty materials which I possess for assisting such a
publication.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable thing, that the two best ballads, perhaps, of modern
times, viz. 'Auld Robin Grey' and the 'Lament for the Defeat of the
Scots at Flodden-field,' are both from the pens of females.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to hear that your health is improved, and your spirits
good, so that the world may continue to be benefited by your judicious
and tasteful labours.</p>

<p>Pray let me hear from you at your leisure; and believe me, dear Sir,</p>

</p>

<p>P.S. It is a pity that Mr. Hartley Coleridge's Sonnets had not been
published before your Collection was made, as there are several well
worthy of a place in it. Last midsummer I made a fortnight's tour in the
Isle of Man, Staffa, Iona, &amp;c., which produced between thirty and forty
sonnets, some of which, I think, would please you.</p>

<p>Could not you contrive to take the Lakes in your way, sometimes, to or
from Scotland? I need not say how glad I should be to see you for a few
days.</p>

MY DEAR MRS. HEMANS,<br />

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You have submitted what you intended as a dedication of your poems to
me. I need scarcely say that, as a <i>private letter</i>, such expressions
from such a quarter could not have been received by me but with pleasure
of <i>no ordinary kind</i>, unchecked by any consideration but the fear that
my writings were overrated by you, and my character thought better of
than it deserved. But I must say, that a <i>public</i> testimony, in so high
a strain of admiration, is what I cannot but shrink from: be this
modesty true or false, it is in me; you must bear with it, and make
allowance for it. And, therefore, as you have submitted the whole to my
judgment, I am emboldened to express a wish that you would, instead of
this dedication, in which your warm and kind heart has overpowered you,
simply inscribe them to me, with such expression of respect or gratitude
as would come within the limits of the rule which, after what has been
said above, will naturally suggest itself. Of course, if the sheet has
been struck off, I must hope that my shoulders may become a little more
Atlantean than I now feel them to be.</p>

MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>Your verses, for which I sincerely thank you, are an additional proof of
the truth which forced from me, many years ago, the exclamation, 'O,
many are the poets that are sown by nature!'<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The rest of that
paragraph also has some<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>{339}</span> bearing upon your position in the poetical
world. The thoughts and images through both the poems, and the feelings
also, are eminently such as become their several subjects; but it would
be insincerity were I to omit adding, that there is here and there a
want of that skill in <i>workmanship</i>, which I believe nothing but
continued practice in the art can bestow. I have used the word <i>art</i>,
from a conviction, which I am called upon almost daily to express, that
poetry is infinitely more of an art than the world is disposed to
believe. Nor is this any dishonour to it; both for the reason that the
poetic faculty is not rarely bestowed, and for this cause, also, that
men would not be disposed to ascribe so much to inspiration, if they did
not feel how near and dear to them poetry is.</p>

MY DEAR MRS. HEMANS,<br />
</p>

<p>I avail myself gladly of the opportunity of Mr. Graves's return, to
acknowledge the honour you have done me in prefixing my name to your
volume of beautiful poems, and to thank you for the copy you have sent
me with your own autograph. Where there is so much to admire, it is
difficult to select; and therefore I shall content myself with naming
only two or three pieces. And, first, let me particularise the piece
that stands second in the volume, 'Flowers and Music in a Sick Room.'
This was especially touching to me, on my poor sister's account, who has
long been an invalid, confined almost to her chamber. The feelings are
sweetly touched throughout this poem, and the imagery very beautiful;
above all, in the passage where you describe the colour of the petals of
the wild rose. This morning, I have read the stanzas upon 'Elysium' with
great pleasure. You have admirably expanded the thought of
Chateaubriand. If we had not been disappointed in our <span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>{340}</span>expected pleasure
of seeing you here, I should have been tempted to speak of many other
passages and poems with which I have been delighted.</p>

<p>Your health, I hope,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> is by this time re&euml;stablished. Your son,
Charles, looks uncommonly well, and we have had the pleasure of seeing
him and his friends several times; but as you are aware, we are much
engaged with visitors at this season of the year, so as not always to be
able to follow our inclinations as to whom we would wish to see. I
cannot conclude without thanking you for your Sonnet upon a place so
dear to me as Grasmere: it is worthy of the subject. With kindest
remembrances, in which unite Mrs. W., my sister, and Dora, I remain,

letter, written during my absence. You know the favourable opinion I
entertain of Mr. Graves; and I was under a promise to let him know, if
any vacancy occurred in the neighbourhood, and to do all I could,
without infringing upon prior or stronger claims, to promote the
attainment of his wishes.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The mind of every thinking man who is attached to the Church of England
must at this time be especially turned to reflections upon all points of
ecclesiastical polity, government, and management, which may tend to
strengthen the Establishment in the affections of the people, and
enlarge the sphere of its efficiency. It cannot, then, I feel, be
impertinent in me, though a layman, to express upon this occasion my
satisfaction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>{341}</span> qualified as it is by what has been said above, in
finding from this instance that our diocesan is unwilling to station
clergymen in cures with which they are locally connected. Some years
ago, when the present Bishop of London, then of Chester, was residing in
this neighbourhood, I took the liberty of strenuously recommending to
him not to ordain young men to curacies where they had been brought up,
or in the midst of their own relatives. I had seen too much of the
mischief of this, especially as affecting the functions and characters
of ministers born and bred up in the lower classes of society. It has
been painful to me to observe the false position, as the French would
call it, in which men so placed are. Their habits, their manners, and
their talk, their acquaintanceships, their friendships, and, let me say,
their domestic affections, naturally and properly draw them one way,
while their professional obligations point out another; and,
accordingly, if they are sensible of both, they live in a perpetual
conflict, and are liable to be taxed with pride and ingratitude, as
seeming to neglect their old friends, when they only associate with them
with that reserve, and under those restraints, which their sacred
profession enjoins. If, on the other hand, they fall into unrestrained
familiarity with the associates of their earlier life and boyish days,
how injurious to their ministry such intercourse would be, must flash
upon every man's mind whose thoughts have turned for a moment to the
subject. Allow me to add a word upon the all-important matter of
testimonials. The case of the Rector of &mdash;&mdash; and of &mdash;&mdash; presses it
closely upon my mind. Had the individuals who signed those documents
been fitly impressed with the awfullness of the act they were about to
engage in, they could not have undertaken it.... Would it not be a good
plan for bishops to exclude testimonials from relatives and near
connections? It is painful to notice what a tendency there is in men's
minds to allow even a slight call of private regard to outweigh a very
strong claim of duty to the public, and not less in sacred concerns than
in civil.</p>

<p>Your hands, my dear friend, have failed, as well as my eyes, so that we
are neither of us in very flourishing trim for active correspondence: be
assured, however, I participate the feelings you express. Last year has
robbed me of Coleridge, of Charles Lamb, James Losh, Rudd, of Trinity,
Fleming, just gone, and other schoolfellows and contemporaries. I cannot
forget that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>{342}</span> Shakspeare, who scarcely survived fifty (I am now near the
close of my sixty-fifth year), wrote,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'In me that time of life thou dost behold,<br /></span>
<span>When yellow leaves, or few, or none, do hang<br /></span>
<span>Upon the bough.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How much more reason have we to break out into such a strain! Let me
hear from you from time to time; I shall feel a lively interest in all
that concerns you. I remain faithfully yours,</p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO THE REV. ROBERT MONTGOMERY.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">Feb. 1835.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>On my return home, after an absence of some length, I have had the
pleasure of receiving your two volumes.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>With your 'Omnipresence of the Deity'<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> I was acquainted long ago,
having read it and other parts of your writings with much pleasure,
though with some abatement, such as you yourself seem sufficiently aware
of, and which, in the works of so young a writer, were by me gently
judged, and in many instances regarded, though in themselves faults, as
indications of future excellence. In your letter, for which also I thank
you, you allude to your Preface, and desire to know if my opinion
concurs with yours on the subject of sacred poetry. That Preface has
been read to me, and I can answer in the affirmative; but at the same
time allow me frankly to tell you that what <i>most</i> pleased me in that
able composition is to be found in the few concluding paragraphs,
beginning 'It is now seven years since,' &amp;c.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I cannot conclude without one word of literary advice, which I hope you
will deem my advanced age entitles me to give. Do not, my dear Sir, be
anxious about any individual's opinion concerning your writings, however
highly you may think of his genius or rate his judgment. Be a severe
critic to yourself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>{343}</span> and depend upon it no person's decision upon the
merit of your works will bear comparison in point of value with your
own. You must be conscious from what feeling they have flowed, and how
far they may or may not be allowed to claim, on that account, permanent
respect; and, above all, I would remind you, with a view to tranquillise
and steady your mind, that no man takes the trouble of surveying and
pondering another's writings with a hundredth part of the care which an
author of sense and genius will have bestowed upon his own. Add to this
reflection another, which I press upon you, as it has supported me
through life, viz. that Posterity will settle all accounts justly, and
that works which deserve to last will last; and if undeserving this
fate, the sooner they perish the better.</p>

<p>

<h3><a name="letter97" id="letter97" ></a>97. <i>A new Church at Cockermouth</i>.</h3>

<div class="center">LETTER TO JAMES STANGER, ESQ.</div>

<p>MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>The obstacle arising out of conflicting opinions in regard to the
patronage, one must be prepared for in every project of this kind.
Mutual giving-way is indispensable, and I hope it will not ultimately be
wanting in this case.</p>

<p>The point immediately to be attended to is the raising a sufficient sum
to insure from the Church Building Societies a portion of the surplus
fund which they have at command, and which I know, on account of claims
from many places, they are anxious to apply as speedily as possible. If
time be lost, that sum will be lost to Cockermouth.</p>

<p>In the question of the patronage as between the bishop and the people, I
entirely concur with you in preference of the former. Such is now the
force of public opinion, that bishops are not likely to present upon
merely selfish considerations; and if the judgment of one be not good,
that of his successor may make amends, and probably will. But elections
of this sort, when vested in the inhabitants, have, as far as my
experience goes, given rise to so many cabals and manoeuvres, and caused
such<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>{344}</span> enmities and heart-burnings, that Christian charity has been
driven out of sight by them: and how often, and how soon, have the
successful party been seen to repent of their own choice!</p>

<p>The course of public affairs being what it is in respect to the Church,
I cannot reconcile myself to delay from a hope of succeeding at another
time. If we can get a new church erected at Cockermouth, great will be
the benefit, with the blessing of God, to that place; and our success
cannot, I trust, but excite some neighbouring places to follow the
example.</p>

<p>The little that I can do in my own sphere shall be attempted
immediately, with especial view to insure the cooperation of the
societies. Happy should I be if you and other gentlemen would
immediately concur in this endeavour.</p>

<h3><a name="letter100" id="letter100" ></a>100. <i>American Edition of Poems,
&amp;c</i></h3>

<div class="center">LETTER TO PROFESSOR HENRY REED, OF PHILADELPHIA.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">London, August 19 [1837].</span><br />
<br />
My Dear Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>Upon returning from a tour of several months upon the Continent, I find
two letters from you awaiting my arrival, along with the edition of my
Poems you have done me the honour of editing. To begin with the former
letter, April 25, 1836: It gives me concern that you should have thought
it necessary (not to <i>apologise</i>, for that you have not done, but) to
explain at length why you addressed me in the language of affectionate
regard. It must surely be gratifying to one, whose aim as an author has
been the hearts of his fellow-creatures of all ranks and in all
stations, to find that he has succeeded in any quarter; and still more
must he be gratified to learn that he has pleased in a distant country
men of simple habits and cultivated taste, who are at the same time
widely acquainted with literature. Your second letter, accompanying the
edition of the Poems, I have read, but unluckily have it not before me.
It was lent to Serjeant Talfourd, on account of the passage in it that
alludes to the possible and desirable establishment of English copyright
in America. I shall now hasten to notice the edition which you have
superintended of my Poems. This I can do with much pleasure, as the
book, which has been shown to several persons of taste, Mr. Rogers in
particular, is allowed to be far the handsomest specimen of printing in
double columns which they have seen. Allow me to thank you for the pains
you have bestowed upon the work. Do not apprehend that any difference in
our several arrangements of the poems can be of much importance; you
appear to understand me far too well for that to be possible. I have
only to regret, in respect to this volume, that it should have been
published before my last edition, in the correction of which I took
great pains, as my last labour in that way, and which moreover contains
several additional pieces. It may be allowed me also to express a hope
that such a law will be passed ere long by the American legislature, as
will place English authors in general upon a better footing in America
than at present they have obtained, and that the protection of copyright
between the two countries will be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>{346}</span>reciprocal. The vast circulation of
English works in America offers a temptation for hasty and incorrect
printing; and that same vast circulation would, without adding to the
price of each copy of an English work in a degree that could be grudged
or thought injurious by any purchaser, allow an American remuneration,
which might add considerably to the comforts of English authors, who may
be in narrow circumstances, yet who at the same time may have written
solely from honourable motives. Besides, Justice is the foundation on
which both law and practice ought to rest.</p>

<p>Having many letters to write on returning to England after so long an
absence, I regret that I must be so brief on the present occasion. I
cannot conclude, however, without assuring you that the acknowledgments
which I receive from the vast continent of America are among the most
grateful that reach me. What a vast field is there open to the English
mind, acting through our noble language! Let us hope that our authors of
true genius will not be unconscious of that thought, or inattentive to
the duty which it imposes upon them, of doing their utmost to instruct,
to purify, and to elevate their readers. That such may be my own
endeavour through the short time I shall have to remain in this world,
is a prayer in which I am sure you and your life's partner will join me.
Believe me gratefully,</p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO EDWARD QUILLINAN, ESQ.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Brinsop Court, Sept. 20. 1837.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR MR. QUILLINAN,<br />
</p>

<p>We are heartily glad to learn from your letter, just received, that, in
all probability, by this time, you must have left the unhappy country in
which you have been so long residing. I should not have been sorry if
you had entered a little more into Peninsular politics; for what is
going on there is shocking to humanity, and one would be glad to see
anything like an opening for the termination of these unnatural
troubles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>{347}</span>The position of the Miguelites, relatively to the conflicting, so
called, liberal parties, is just what I apprehended, and expressed very
lately to Mr. Robinson....</p>

<p>He came down with us to Hereford with a view to a short tour on the
banks of the Wye, which has been prevented by an unexpected attack of my
old complaint of inflammation in the eye; and in consequence of this,
Dora will accompany me home, with a promise on her part of returning to
London before the month of October is out. Our places are taken in
to-morrow's coach for Liverpool; so that, since we must be disappointed
of seeing you and Jemima here, we trust that you will come on to Rydal
from Leeds. This very day Dora had read to me your poem again: it
convinces me, along with your other writings, that it is in your power
to attain a permanent place among the poets of England. Your thoughts,
feelings, knowledge, and judgment in style, and skill in metre, entitle
you to it; and, if you have not yet succeeded in gaining it, the cause
appears to me merely to lie in the subjects which you have chosen. It is
worthy of note how much of Gray's popularity is owing to the happiness
with which his subject is selected in three places, his 'Hymn to
Adversity,' his 'Ode on the distant Prospect of Eton College,' and his
'Elegy.' I ought, however, in justice to you, to add, that one cause of
your failure appears to have been thinking too humbly of yourself, so
that you have not reckoned it worth while to look sufficiently round you
for the best subjects, or to employ as much time in reflecting,
condensing, bringing out and placing your thoughts and feelings in the
best point of view as is necessary. I will conclude this matter of
poetry and my part of the letter, with requesting that, as an act of
friendship, at your convenience, you would take the trouble&mdash;a
considerable one, I own&mdash;of comparing the corrections in my last edition
with the text in the preceding one. You know my principles of style
better, I think, than any one else; and I should be glad to learn if
anything strikes you as being altered for the worse. You will find the
principal changes are in 'The White Doe,' in which I had too little of
the benefit of your help and judgment. There are several also in the
Sonnets, both miscellaneous and political: in the other poems they are
nothing like so numerous; but here also I should be glad if you would
take the like trouble. Jemima, I am sure, will be pleased to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>{348}</span> assist you
in the comparison, by reading, new or old, as you may think fit. With
love to her, I remain,</p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO THE EARL OF LONSDALE.</div>

<p>After having had excellent health during my long ramble [in
Herefordshire], it is unfortunate that I should thus be disabled at the
conclusion. The mischief came to me in Herefordshire, whither I had gone
on my way home to see my brother-in-law, who, by his horse falling with
him some time ago, was left without the use of his limbs.</p>

<p>I was lately a few days with Mr. Rogers, at Broadstairs, and also with
the Archbishop of Canterbury, at Addington Park; they were both well,
and I was happy to see the Archbishop much stronger than his slender and
almost feeble appearance would lead one to expect. We walked up and down
in the park for three hours one day, and nearly four the next, without
his seeming to be the least fatigued. I mention this as we must all feel
the value of his life in this state of public affairs.</p>

<p>The cholera prevented us getting as far as Naples, which was the only
disappointment we met with. As a man of letters I have to regret that
this most interesting tour was not made by me earlier in life, as I
might have turned the notices it has supplied me with to more account
than I now expect to do. With respectful remembrances to Lady Lonsdale,
and to your Lordship, in which Mrs. W. unites,</p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Dec. 23. 1837.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>I have just received your valuable present of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>{349}</span>Bentley's works, for
which accept my cordial thanks, as also for the leaf to be added to
Akenside.</p>

<p>Is it recorded in your Memoir of Akenside,&mdash;for I have not leisure nor
eyesight at present to look,&mdash;that he was fond of sitting in St. James's
Park with his eyes upon Westminster Abbey? This, I am sure, I have
either read or heard of him; and I imagine that it was from Mr. Rogers.
I am not unfrequently a visitor on Hampstead Heath, and seldom pass by
the entrance of Mr. Dyson's villa on Goulder's Hill, close by, without
thinking of the pleasure which Akenside often had there.</p>

<p>I cannot call to mind a reason why you should not think some passages in
'The Power of Sound' equal to anything I have produced. When first
printed in the 'Yarrow Revisited,' I placed it at the end of the volume,
and, in the last edition of my Poems, at the close of the Poems of
Imagination, indicating thereby my <i>own</i> opinion of it.</p>

<p>How much do I regret that I have neither learning nor eyesight
thoroughly to enjoy Bentley's masterly 'Dissertation upon the Epistles
of Phalaris'! Many years ago I read the work with infinite pleasure. As
far as I know, or rather am able to judge, it is without a rival in that
department of literature; a work of which the English nation may be
proud as long as acute intellect, and vigorous powers, and profound
scholarship shall be esteemed in the world.</p>

<p>Let me again repeat my regret that in passing to and from Scotland you
have never found it convenient to visit this part of the country. I
should be delighted to see you, and I am sure Mr. Southey would be the
same: and in his house you would find an inexhaustible collection of
books, many curious no doubt; but his classical library is much the
least valuable part of it. The death of his excellent wife was a
deliverance for herself and the whole family, so great had been her
sufferings of mind and body.</p>

<p>You do not say a word about Skelton; and I regret much your
disappointment in respect of Middleton.</p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO SIR WILLIAM R. HAMILTON.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Dec. 21 [1837].</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SIR WILLIAM,<br />
</p>

<p>The papers had informed me of the honour conferred upon you, and I was
intending to congratulate you on the occasion, when your letter arrived.
The electors have done great credit to themselves by appointing you, and
not a little by rejecting the ultra-liberal Archbishop, and that by so
decided a majority. We are much pleased that your sister, who we
conclude is well, has sent her Poems to press, and wish they may obtain
the attention we are sure they will merit. Your own two Sonnets, for
which I thank you, we read, that is Mrs. W. and myself (Dora is in the
South), with interest. But to the main purport of your letter. You pay
me an undeserved compliment in requesting my opinion, how you could best
promote some of the benefits which the Society, at whose head you are
placed, aims at. As to patronage, you are right in supposing that I hold
it in little esteem for helping genius forward in the fine arts,
especially those whose medium is words. Sculpture and painting <i>may</i> be
helped by it; but even in those departments there is much to be dreaded.
The French have established an Academy at Rome upon an extensive scale;
and so far from doing good, I was told by every one that it had done
much harm. The plan is this: they select the most distinguished students
from the school or academy at Paris and send them to Rome, with handsome
stipends, by which they are tempted into idleness, and of course into
vice. So that it looks like a contrivance for preventing the French
nation and the world at large profiting by the genius which nature may
have bestowed, and which left to itself would in some cases, perhaps,
have prospered. The principal, I was indeed told the only, condition
imposed upon these students is, that each of them send annually some
work of his hands to Paris. When at Rome, I saw a good deal of English
artists. They seemed to be living happily and doing well, tho', as you
are aware, the public patronage any of them receive is trifling.</p>

<p>Genius in poetry, or any department of what is called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>{351}</span> Belles
Lettres, is much more likely to be cramped than fostered by public
support: better wait to reward those who have done their work, tho' even
here national rewards are not necessary, unless the labourers be, if not
in poverty, at least in narrow circumstances. Let the laws be but just
to them and they will be sure of attaining competence, if they have not
misjudged their own talents or misapplied them.</p>

<p>The cases of Chatterton, Burns, and others, might, it should seem, be
urged against the conclusion that help beforehand is not required; but I
do think that in the temperament of the two I have mentioned there was
something which, however favourable had been their circumstances,
however much they had been encouraged and supported, would have brought
on their ruin. As to what Patronage can do in Science, discoveries in
Physics, mechanic arts, &amp;c., you know far better than I can pretend to
do.</p>

<p>As to 'better canons of criticism and general improvement of scholars,'
I really, speaking without affectation, am so little of a Critic or
Scholar, that it would be presumptuous in me to <i>write</i> upon the subject
to you. If we were together and you should honour me by asking my
opinion upon particular points, that would be a very different thing,
and I might have something to say not wholly without value. But where
could I begin with so comprehensive an argument, and how could I put
into the compass of a letter my thoughts, such as they may be, with
anything like order? It is somewhat mortifying to me to disappoint you.
You must upon reflection I trust perceive, that in attempting to comply
with your wish I should only lose myself in a wilderness. I have been
applied to to give lectures upon Poetry in a public institution in
London, but I was conscious that I was neither competent to the office,
nor the public prepared to receive what I should have felt it my duty to
say, however [inadequately?].</p>

<p>I have [had] a very pleasant and not profitless tour on the Continent,
tho' with one great drawback, the being obliged on account of the
cholera to return without seeing Naples and its neighbourhood. Had it
not been for the state of my eyes, which became inflamed after I got
back to England, I should have been able to take Liverpool in my way
home, at the time you were there. The attack continued for a long time,
and has left a weakness in the organ which does not yet allow me either
to read or write; but with care I hope to come about.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>{352}</span></p>

<p>My sister continues in the same enfeebled state of mind and body. Mrs.
W. is well; but your godson, we hear, is suffering from derangement of
the stomach, so that at present he is not a thriving child, but his
elder brother is now remarkably so, and he about the same age was
subject to the same trials. We trust that your little family are all
flourishing, and with our united affectionate regards believe me,
faithfully,</p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO SIR WILLIAM R. HAMILTON.</div>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Jan. 4. 1838.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SIR WILLIAM,<br />
</p>

<p>From a hope of something starting up in my mind which might prevent my
letter being an utter disappointment, I have not answered yours, as I
wished to do, by return of post. But I am really still as much at a loss
how to make my letter worth reading as if I had replied immediately.
Allow me, however, to thank you for your last, which has completely done
away with the vagueness of the former; I now distinctly understand you,
and as to one of your leading points, viz. availing myself of
publication through your Society, I may say that if there had been among
my papers anything of the kind you wish for, I should have gladly
forwarded it to you. But it is not so, nor dare I undertake to promise
anything of the kind for the future. Though prevailed upon by Mr.
Coleridge to write the first Preface to my Poems, which tempted, or
rather forced, me to add a supplement to it, and induced by my
friendship for him to write the Essay upon Epitaphs now appended to 'The
Excursion,' but first composed for 'The Friend,' I have never felt
inclined to write criticism, though I have talked, and am daily talking,
a great deal. If I were several years younger, out of friendship to you
mainly, I would sit down to the task of giving a body to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>{353}</span> my notions
upon the essentials of Poetry; a subject which could not be properly
treated, without adverting to the other branches of fine art. But at
present, with so much before me that I could wish to do in verse, and
the melancholy fact brought daily more and more home to my conviction,
that intellectual labour, by its action on the brain and nervous system,
is injurious to the bodily powers, and especially to my eyesight, I
should only be deceiving myself and misleading you, were I to encourage
a hope that, much as I could wish to be your fellow-labourer, however
humbly, I shall ever become so.</p>

<p>Having disposed of this rather painful part of the subject of your
letter, let me say, that though it is principally matters of science in
which publication through your Society would be serviceable, and indeed
in that department eminently so, I concur with you in thinking, that the
same vehicle would be useful for bringing under the notice of the
thinking part of the community critical essays of too abstract a
character to be fit for popularity. There are obviously, even in
criticism, two ways of affecting the minds of men&mdash;the one by treating
the matter so as to carry it immediately to the sympathies of the many;
and the other, by aiming at a few select and superior minds, that might
each become a centre for illustrating it in a popular way. Mr.
Coleridge, whom you allude to, acted upon the world to a great extent
thro' the latter of these processes; and there cannot be a doubt that
your Society might serve the cause of just thinking and pure taste
should you, as president of it, hold up to view the desirableness of
first conveying to a few, thro' that channel, reflections upon
literature and art, which, if well meditated, would be sure of winning
their way directly, or in their indirect results to a gradually widening
circle.</p>

<p>May I not encourage a hope that during the ensuing summer, or at the
worst at no distant period, you and I might meet, when a few hours'
conversation would effect more than could come out of a dozen letters
dictated, and hastily, as I am obliged to dictate this, from an
unexpected interruption when Mrs. W. and I were sitting down with the
pen in her hand?</p>

<p>You are right in your recollection that I named to you the subject of
foreign piracy, as injurious to English authors; and I may add now that
if it could be put a stop to, I believe that it would rarely happen that
successful writers, on works of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>{354}</span>imagination and feeling at least, would
stand in need of pensions from Government, or would feel themselves
justified in accepting them. Upon this subject I have spoken a great
deal to M.P.'s of all parties, and with several distinguished Americans.
I have also been in correspondence with the present Chancellor of the
Exchequer upon it, and dwelt upon the same topic in a letter which I had
occasion to write to Sir Robert Peel. Mr. Lytton Bulwer, as perhaps you
know, drew the attention of Parliament to it during the late Session.
Lord Palmerston said in answer to him, that the attention of Government
had already been directed to the measure, and that it would not be lost
sight of, or something to that purpose. I may claim some credit for my
exertions in this business, and full as much, or more, for the pains
which I have taken for many years, to interest men in the H[ouse] of
C[ommons] in the extension of the term of copyright&mdash;a measure which I
trust is about to be brought to a successful close by the exertions of
my admirable friend Serjeant Talfourd. To him I have written upon the
argument more than once. When this is effected, I trust the other part
of the subject will be taken up with spirit, and if the Foreign
Secretary, in whose department the matter lies, should be remiss, I
trust he will be stimulated thro' Parliament, to which desirable end the
services of distinguished societies like yours, and the notice of the
question, by men of letters, in reviews or otherwise, would greatly
contribute. Good authors, if justice were done to them by their own and
foreign countries, now that reading is spread and spreading so widely,
would very few of them be in need, except thro' their own fault.</p>

<p>When I was in town last August, the American minister, Mr. Stephenson,
spoke to me with much indignation of the law and practice by which
copyright was secured in England for American authors, while there was
no reciprocity for English writers in America.</p>

<p>But I must conclude, or I shall miss the post. The father of your godson
is here, and begs to be remembered to you.</p>

<p>Did I ever mention to you that owing to the sea having swallowed up his
father-in-law's coal-pits,... income is much reduced; and he therefore
feels it necessary to endeavour to procure a couple of pupils, who could
afford to pay rather handsomely for the advantages they would have under
his roof? By<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>{355}</span> this time he would have succeeded, but parents in the
South have an unaccountable objection to sending their sons so far
North. As the same might not be felt in Ireland, I take the liberty of
mentioning his wish to you, being persuaded that if you can you will
assist him in his views. If your address to your Society should be
published, could you send it me, and acquaint me with what you have
done?</p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO HENRY REED, ESQ., PHILADELPHIA.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Dec. 23. 1839.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>The year is upon the point of expiring; and a letter of yours, dated May
7th, though not received till late in June (for I was moving about all
last spring and part of the summer), remains unacknowledged. I have also
to thank you for the acceptable present of the two volumes which reached
me some time afterwards.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Your letters are naturally turned upon the impression which my poems
have made, and the estimation they are held, or likely to be held in,
through the vast country to which you belong. I wish I could feel as
lively as you do upon this subject, or even upon the general destiny of
those works. Pray do not be long surprised at this declaration. There is
a difference of more than the length of your life, I believe, between
our ages. I am standing on the brink of that vast ocean I must sail so
soon; I must speedily lose sight of the shore; and I could not once have
conceived how little I now am troubled by the thought of how long or
short a time they who remain on that shore may have sight of me. The
other day I chanced to be looking over a MS. poem, belonging to the year
1803, though not actually composed till many years afterwards. It was
suggested by visiting the neighbourhood of Dumfries, in which Burns had
resided, and where he died; it concluded thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Sweet Mercy to the gales of heaven<br /></span>
<span>This minstrel led, his sins forgiven;<br /></span>
</div></div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>{356}</span>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>The rueful conflict, the heart riven<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With vain endeavour,<br /></span>
<span>And memory of earth's bitter leaven<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Effaced for ever.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here the verses closed; but I instantly added, the other day,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'But why to him confine the prayer,<br /></span>
<span>When kindred thoughts and yearnings bear<br /></span>
<span>On the frail heart the purest share<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With all that live?<br /></span>
<span>The best of what we do and are.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Just God, forgive!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The more I reflect upon this last exclamation, the more I feel (and
perhaps it may in some degree be the same with you) justified in
attaching comparatively small importance to any literary monument that I
may be enabled to leave behind. It is well, however, I am convinced,
that men think otherwise in the earlier part of their lives; and why it
is so, is a point I need not touch upon in writing to you.</p>

<p>Before I dismiss this subject let me thank you for the extract from your
intelligent friend's letter; and allow me to tell you that I could not
but smile at your Boston critic placing my name by the side of Cowley. I
suppose he cannot mean anything more than that the same measure of
reputation or fame (if that be not too presumptuous a word) is due to us
both.</p>

<p>German transcendentalism, which you say this critic is infected by,
would be a woeful visitation for the world.</p>

<p>The way in which you speak of me in connection with your possible visit
to England was most gratifying; and I here repeat that I should be truly
glad to see you in the delightful spot where I have long dwelt; and I
have the more pleasure in saying this to you, because, in spite of my
old infirmity, my strength exceeds that of most men of my years, and my
general health continues to be, as it always has been, remarkably good.
A page of blank paper stares me in the face; and I am not sure that it
is worth while to fill it with a sonnet which broke from me not long ago
in reading an account of misdoings in many parts of your Republic. Mrs.
Wordsworth will, however, transcribe it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Men of the Western World! in Fate's dark book,<br /></span>
<span>Whence these opprobrious leaves, of dire portent?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To turn to another subject. You will be sorry to learn that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>{357}</span> several of
my most valued friends are likely to suffer from the monetary
derangements in America. My family, however, is no way directly
entangled, unless the Mississippi bonds prove invalid. There is an
opinion pretty current among discerning persons in England, that
Republics are not to be trusted in money concerns,&mdash;I suppose because
the sense of honour is more obtuse, the responsibility being divided
among so many. For my own part, I have as little or less faith in
absolute despotisms, except that they are more easily convinced that it
is politic to keep up their credit by holding to their engagements. What
power is maintained by this practice was shown by Great Britain in her
struggle with Buonaparte. This lesson has not been lost on the leading
monarchical states of Europe. But too much of this.</p>

<p>It was not a little provoking that I had not the pleasure of shaking you
by the hand at Oxford when you did me the honour of coming so far to
'join in the shout.' I was told by a Fellow of University College that
he had never witnessed such an outburst of enthusiasm in that place,
except upon the occasions of the visits of the Duke of Wellington&mdash;one
unexpected. My Nephew, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, was
present, as well as my son, William, who, I am happy to say, is much

desires to be kindly remembered to you.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

MY DEAR LADY FREDERICK,<br />
</p>

<p>Yesterday brought us melancholy news in a letter from my brother, Dr.
Wordsworth, which announced the death of his eldest son. He died last
Tuesday, in Trinity College, of which he was a fellow, having been
tenderly nursed by his father during rather a long illness. He was a
most amiable man, and I have reason to believe was one of the best
scholars in Europe. We were all strongly attached to him, and, as his
poor father writes, the loss is to him, and to his sorrowing sons,
irreparable on this side of the grave.</p>

The departed was beloved in this house as he deserved to be; but our

his brothers'. He is a power gone out of our family, and they will be
perpetually reminded of it. But the best of all consolations will be

MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>Pray impute to anything but a want of due sympathy with you in your
affliction my not having earlier given an answer to your letter. In
truth, I was so much moved by it, that I had not, at first, sufficient
resolution to bring my thoughts so very close to your trouble, as must
have been done had I taken up the pen immediately. I have been myself
distressed in the same way, though my two children were taken from me at
an earlier age, one in her fifth, the other in his seventh year, and
within half a year of each other. I can, therefore, enter into your
sorrows more feelingly than for others is possible, who have not
suffered like losses.</p>

<p>Your departed daughter struck me as having one of the most intelligent
and impressive countenances I ever looked upon, and I spoke of her as
such to Mrs. Wordsworth, Miss Fenwick, and to others. The indications
which I saw in her of a somewhat alarming state of health, I could not
but mention to you, when you accompanied me a little way from your own
door. You spoke something encouraging; but they continued to haunt me;
so that your kind letter was something less of a shock than it would
otherwise have been, though not less of a sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>{360}</span>How pathetic is your account of the piety with which the dear creature
supported herself under those severe trials of mind and body with which
it pleased God to prepare her for a happier world! The consolation which
<i>children</i> and very young persons, who have been religiously brought up,
draw from the Holy Scriptures, ought to be habitually on the minds of
<i>adults</i> of all ages, for the benefit of their own souls, and requires
to be treated in a loftier and more comprehensive train of thought and
feeling than by writers has been usually bestowed upon it. It does not,
therefore, surprise me that you hinted at my own pen being employed upon
the subject, as brought before the mind in your lamented daughter's own
most touching case. I wish I were equal to anything so holy, but I feel
that I am not. It is remarkable, however, that within the last few days
the subject has been presented to my mind by two several persons, both
unknown to me; which is something of a proof how widely its importance
is felt, and also that there is a feeling that I am not wholly unworthy
of treating it.</p>

<p>Your letter, my dear Sir, I value exceedingly, and shall take the
liberty, as I have done more than once, with fit reverence, of reading
it in quarters where it is likely to do good, or rather, where I know it
must do good.</p>

<p>Wishing and praying that the Almighty may bestow upon yourself, the
partner in your bereavement, and all the fellow-sufferers in your
household, that consolation and support which can proceed only from His
grace,</p>

<p>

<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>Pray excuse my having been some little time in your debt. I could plead
many things in extenuation, the chief, that old one of the state of my
eyes, which never leaves me at liberty either to read or write a tenth
part as much as I could wish, and as otherwise I ought to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>{361}</span>It cannot but be highly gratifying to me to learn that my writings are
prized so highly by a poet and critic of your powers. The essay upon
them which you have so kindly sent me seems well qualified to promote
your views in writing it. I was particularly pleased with your
distinction between religion in poetry, and versified religion. For my
own part, I have been averse to frequent mention of the mysteries of
Christian faith; not from a want of a due sense of their momentous
nature, but the contrary. I felt it far too deeply to venture on
handling the subject as familiarly as many scruple not to do. I am far
from blaming them, but let them not blame me, nor turn from my
companionship on that account. Besides general reasons for diffidence in
treating subjects of Holy Writ, I have some especial ones. I might err
in points of faith, and I should not deem my mistakes less to be
deprecated because they were expressed in metre. Even Milton, in my
humble judgment, has erred, and grievously; and what poet could hope to
atone for his apprehensions<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> in the way in which that mighty mind
has done?</p>

<p>I am not at all desirous that any one should write an elaborate critique
on my poetry.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> There is no call for it. If they be from above, they
will do their own work in course of time; if not, they will perish as
they ought. But scarcely a week passes in which I do not receive
grateful acknowledgments of the good they have done to the minds of the
several writers. They speak of the relief they have received from them
under affliction and in grief, and of the calmness and elevation of
spirit which the poems either give or assist them in attaining. As these
benefits are not without a traceable bearing upon the good of the
immortal soul, the sooner, perhaps, they are pointed out and illustrated
in a work like yours, the better.</p>

<p>Pray excuse my talking so much about myself: your letter and critique
called me to the subject. But I assure you it would have been more
grateful to me to acknowledge the debt we owe you in this house, where
we have read your poems with no common pleasure. Your 'Abbot of
Muchelnage' also makes me curious to hear more of him.</p>

<p>But I must conclude,</p>

<p>I was truly sorry to have missed you when you and Mrs. Alford<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>{362}</span> called at

<p>I must try to give you a summary of a long conversation I had with
Wordsworth on the subject of <i>sacred poetry,</i> and which I wish I were
able to report in full. In the course of it he expressed to me the
feelings of reverence which prevented him from venturing to lay his hand
on what he always thought a subject too high for him; and he accompanied
this with the earnest protest that his works, as well as those of any
other poet, should not be considered as developing all the influences
which his own heart recognised, but rather those which he considered
himself able as an artist to display to advantage, and which he thought
most applicable to the wants, and admitted by the usages, of the world
at large. This was followed by a most interesting discussion upon
Milton, Cowper, the general progress of religion as an element of
poetry, and the gradual steps by which it must advance to a power
comprehensive and universally admitted; steps which are defined in their
order by the constitution of the human mind, and which must proceed with
vastly more slowness in the case of the progress made by collective
minds, than it does in an individual soul.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO LADY FREDERICK BENTINCK.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">July 1840.</span><br />
</p>

<p>I hope, dear Lady Frederick, that nothing will prevent my appearance at
Lowther towards the end of next week. But I have for these last few
years been visited always with a serious inflammation in my eyes about
this season of the year, which causes me to have fears about the
fulfilment of any engagement, however agreeable. Pray thank Lord
Lonsdale, on my part, for his thinking of me upon this occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>{363}</span>On Monday morning, a little before nine, a beautiful and bright day,
the Queen Dowager and her sister appeared at Rydal. I met them at the
lower waterfall, with which her Majesty seemed much pleased. Upon
hearing that it was not more than half a mile to the higher fall, she
said, briskly, she would go; though Lord Denbigh and Lord Howe felt that
they were pressed for time, having to go upon Keswick Lake, and thence
to Paterdale. I walked by the Queen's side up to the higher waterfall,
and she seemed to be struck much with the beauty of the scenery. Her
step was exceedingly light; but I learned that her health is not good,
or rather that she still suffers from the state of her constitution,
which caused her to go abroad.</p>

<p>Upon quitting the park of Rydal, nearly opposite our own gate, the Queen
was saluted with a pretty rural spectacle; nearly fifty children, drawn
up in avenue, with bright garlands in their hands, three large flags
flying, and a band of music. They had come from Ambleside, and the
garlands were such as are annually prepared at this season for a
ceremony called 'the Rush-bearing;' and the parish-clerk of Ambleside
hit upon this way of showing at Rydal the same respect to the Queen
which had been previously shown at Ambleside. I led the Queen to the
principal points of view in our little domain, particularly to that,
through the summer house, which shows the lake of Rydal to such
advantage. The Queen talked more than once about having a cottage among
the lakes, which of course was nothing more than a natural way of giving
vent to the pleasure which she had in the country. You will think, I
fear, that I have dwelt already too long upon the subject; and I shall
therefore only add, that all went off satisfactorily, and that every one
was delighted with her Majesty's demeanour. Lord and Lady Sheffield were
the only persons of her suite whom I had seen before. Lord Howe was
pleased with the sight of the pictures from his friend Sir George
Beaumont's pencil, and showed them to the Queen, who, having sat some
little time in the house, took her leave, cordially shaking Mrs.
Wordsworth by the hand, as a friend of her own rank might have done. She
had also inquired for Dora, who was introduced to her. I hope she will
come again into the country, and visit Lowther.</p>

<p>Pray excuse the above long story, which I should not have ventured upon,
but that you expressed a wish upon the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>{364}</span>What enchanting weather! I hope, and do not doubt, that you all enjoy
it, my dear Lady Frederick, as we are doing.</p>

<p>I ought not to forget, that two days ago I went over to see Mr. Southey,
or rather Mrs. Southey, for he is past taking pleasure in the presence
of any of his friends. He did not recognise me till he was told. Then
his eyes flashed for a moment with their former brightness, but he sank
into the state in which I had found him, patting with both hands his
books affectionately, like a child. Having attempted in vain to interest
him by a few observations, I took my leave, after five minutes or so. It
was, for me, a mournful visit, and for his poor wife also. His health is
good, and he may live many years; though the body is much enfeebled.</p>

DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>Upon returning home after an absence of ten days, I have the pleasure of
finding your obliging letter, and the number of the <i>Ecclesiastical
Gazette</i> containing the 'Ecclesiastical Duties and Revenues Act:' for
both marks of attention I beg you to accept my sincere thanks. As soon
as I can find leisure, I will carefully peruse the Act; at present I can
only say that I look upon changes so extensive and searching with a
degree of alarm proportionate to my love and affection for the
Establishment with which they are connected.</p>

<p>As you have put me in possession of the <i>Gazette</i>, I can scarcely feel
justified in looking to the fulfilment of your promise to send me the
Act, separately printed. Indeed, I feel that it would be giving yourself
more trouble than there is occasion for.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Sept. 26. 1840.</span><br />
<br />
DEAR LADY FREDERICK,<br />
</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers and I had a pleasant journey to Rydal the day we left all our
kind friends at Lowther. We alighted at Lyulph's Tower, and saw the
waterfall in great power after the night's rain, the sun shining full
into the chasm, and making a splendid rainbow of the spray. Afterwards,
walking through Mr. Askew's grounds, we saw the lake to the greatest
possible advantage. Mr. R. left on Thursday, the morning most beautiful,
though it rained afterwards. I know not how he could tear himself away
from this lovely country at this charming season. I say charming,
notwithstanding this is a dull day; but yesterday was most glorious. I
hope our excellent friend does not mean to remain in London.</p>

<p>We have had no visits from strangers since my return, so that the press
of the season seems to be over. The leaves are not changed here so much
as at Lowther, and of course not yet so beautiful, nor are they ever
quite so as with you, your trees being so much finer, and your woods so
very much more extensive. We have a great deal of coppice, which makes
but a poor show in autumn compared with timber trees.</p>

<p>Your son George knows what he has to expect in the few sheets which I
enclose for him.</p>

<p>With many thanks for the endless kind attentions which I received from
you, and others under your father's hospitable roof, and with my
grateful respects to him, and a thousand good wishes for all, I remain,
my wife and daughter joining in these feelings, My dear Lady Frederick,
affectionately yours,</p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO LADY FREDERICK BENTINCK.</div>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Monday Evening.</span><br />


<p>The accident after which you inquire, dear Lady Frederick, with so much
feeling, might have been fatal, but through God's mercy we escaped
without bodily injury, as far as I know, worth naming. These were the
particulars: About three miles beyond Keswick, on the Ambleside road, is
a small bridge, from the top of which we got sight of the mail coach
coming towards us, at about forty yards' distance, just before the road
begins to descend a narrow, steep, and winding slope. Nothing was left
for J&mdash;&mdash;, who drove the gig in which we were, but to cross the bridge,
and, as the road narrowed up the slope that was in our front, to draw up
as close to the wall on our left (our side of the road) as possible.
This he did, both of us hoping that the coachman would slacken his pace
down the hill, and pass us as far from our wheel as the road would
allow. But he did neither. On the contrary, he drove furiously down the
hill; and though, as we afterwards ascertained, by the track of his
wheels, he had a yard width of road to spare, he made no use of it. In
consequence of this recklessness and his want of skill, the wheel of his
coach struck our wheel most violently, drove back our horse and gig some
yards, and then sent us all together through a small gap in the wall,
with the stones of the wall tumbling about us, into a plantation that
lay a yard perpendicular below the level of the road from which the
horse and gig, with us in it, had been driven. The shafts were broken
off close to the carriage, and we were partly thrown and partly leaped
out. After breaking the traces, the horse leaped back into the road and
galloped off, the shafts and traces sticking to him; nor did the poor
creature stop till he reached the turnpike at Grasmere, seven miles from
the spot where the mischief was done. We sent by the coach for a chaise
to take us to Rydal, and hired a cart to take the broken gig to be
mended at Keswick.</p>

<p>The mercy was, that the violent shock from the coach did not tear off
our wheel; for if this had been done, J&mdash;&mdash;, and probably I also, must
have fallen under the hind wheels of the coach, and in all likelihood
been killed. We have since learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>{367}</span> that the coachman had only just come
upon the road, which is in a great many places very dangerous, and that
he was wholly unpractised in driving four-in-hand. Pray excuse this long
and minute account. I should have written to you next day, but I waited,
hoping to be able to add that my indisposition was gone, as I now trust
it is.</p>

<p>With respectful remembrances to Lord Lonsdale, and kindest regards to
yourself and Miss Thompson, I remain,</p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO HENRY REED, ESQ., PHILADELPHIA.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Jan. 13. 1841.</span><br />
MY DEAR MR. REED,<br />
</p>

<p>It is gratifying to learn that through your means Mr. Alston has been
reminded of me. We became acquainted many years ago through our common
friend Mr. Coleridge, who had seen much of Mr. Alston when they were
both living at Rome.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You mention the Sonnet I wrote upon Haydon's picture of the Duke of
Wellington. I have known Haydon, and Wilkie also, from their
contemporaneous introduction to the world as artists; their powers were
perceived and acknowledged by my lamented friend Sir George Beaumont,
and patronised by him accordingly; and it was at his house where I first
became acquainted with them both. Haydon is bent upon coming to Rydal
next summer, with a view to paint a likeness of me, not as a mere
matter-of-fact portrait, but one of a poetical character, in which he
will endeavour to place his friend in some favourite scene of these
mountains. I am rather afraid, I own, of any attempt of this kind,
notwithstanding my high opinion of his ability; but if he keeps in his
present mind, which I doubt, it will be in vain to oppose his
inclination. He is a great enthusiast, possessed also of a most active
intellect, but he wants that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>{368}</span> submissive and steady good sense which is
absolutely necessary for the adequate development of power in that art
to which he is attached.</p>

<p>As I am on the subject of painting, it may be worth while to add, that
Pickersgill came down last summer to paint a portrait of me for Sir
Robert Peel's gallery at Drayton Manor. It was generally thought here
that this work was more successful than the one he painted some years
ago for St. John's College, at the request of the Master and
Fellows.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>I have no especial reason for writing at this moment of time, but I have
long wished to thank you for the 'Apology for Cathedrals,' which I have
learned is from your pen. The little work does you great credit; it is
full of that wisdom which the heart and imagination alone could
adequately supply for such a subject; and is, moreover, very pleasingly
diversified by styles of treatment all good in their kind. I need add no
more than that I entirely concur in the views you take: but what avails
it? the mischief is done, and they who have been most prominent in
setting it on foot will have to repent of their narrow comprehension;
which, however, is no satisfaction to us, who from the first foresaw the
evil tendency of the measure.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Though I can make but little use of my eyes in writing or reading, I
have lately been reading Cowper's 'Task' aloud; and in so doing was
tempted to look over the parallelisms, for which Mr. Southey was in his
edition indebted to you. Knowing how comprehensive your acquaintance
with poetry is, I was rather surprised that you did not notice the
identity of the thought, and accompanying illustrations of it, in a
passage of Shenstone's Ode upon Rural Elegance, compared with one in
'The Task,' where Cowper speaks of the inextinguishable love of the
country as manifested by the inhabitants of cities in their culture of
plants and flowers, where the want of air, cleanliness, and light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>{369}</span> is
so unfavourable to their growth and beauty. The germ of the main thought
is to be found in Horace,</p>

<p>MY DEAR MR. REED,</p>

<p>I have lately had the pleasure of seeing, both in London and at my own
house, the Bishop of New Jersey. He is a man of no ordinary powers of
mind and attainments, of warm feelings and sincere piety. Indeed, I
never saw a person of your country, which is remarkable for cordiality,
whose manner was so thoroughly cordial. He had been greatly delighted
with his reception in England, and what he had seen of it both in Art
and Nature. By the by, I heard him preach an excellent sermon in London.
I believe this privilege is of modern date. The Bishop has furnished me
with his funeral sermon upon Bishop White, to assist me in fulfilling a
request which you first made to me, viz. that I would add a Sonnet to my
Ecclesiastical Series, upon the union of the two Episcopal churches of
England and America.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> I will endeavour to do so, when I have more
leisure than at present, this being the season when our beautiful region
attracts many strangers, who take up much of my time.</p>

<p>Do you know Miss Peabody of Boston? She has just sent me, with the
highest eulogy, certain essays of Mr. Emerson. Our Mr. Carlyle and he
appear to be what the French used to call <i>esprits forts</i>, though the
French idols showed their spirit after a somewhat different fashion. Our
two present Philosophes, who have taken a language which they suppose to
be English for their vehicle, are verily 'par nobile fratrum,' and it is
a pity that the weakness of our age has not left them exclusively to
this appropriate reward&mdash;mutual admiration. Where is the thing which now
passes for philosophy at Boston to stop?</p>

<p>Mrs. W. is quite well. We were three months and as many weeks absent

<p>In the summer of 1842, Wordsworth resigned his office of Stamp
Distributor; not, however, on a retiring pension, as has been sometimes
asserted. In a letter, dated March 2, 1840, and addressed to Lord
Morpeth, he says, 'I never did seek or accept a pension from the present
or any other administration, directly or indirectly.' But the duties,
and also the emoluments, of the Distributorship were transferred to his

<p>MY DEAR C&mdash;&mdash;,</p>

<p>Your father left us yesterday, having been just a week under our roof.
The weather was favourable, and he seemed to enjoy himself much. His
muscular strength, as proved by the walks we took together, is great.
One day we were nearly four hours on foot, without resting, and he did
not appear in the least fatigued.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>{373}</span>We all thought him looking well, and his mind appears as active as ever.
It was a great delight to us to see him here.</p>

<p>He was anxious to see Charles; he will reach Winchester this afternoon,
I hope without injury. Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Wade! From his own modest merits, and his long connection with
Mr. Coleridge, and with my early Bristol remembrances, he was to me an
interesting person. His desire to have my address must have risen, I
think, from a wish to communicate with me upon the subject of Mr.
Alston's valuable portrait of Coleridge. Pray tell me what has, or is
likely to, become of it. I care comparatively little about the matter,
provided due care has been taken for its preservation, and in his native
country. It would be a sad pity if the late owner's intention of sending
it to America be fulfilled. It is the only likeness of the great
original that ever gave me the least pleasure; and it is, in fact, most
happily executed, as every one who has a distinct remembrance of what C.
was at that time must with delight acknowledge, and would be glad to
certify.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, March 24. 1843.</span><br />

<p>MY DEAR SIR WILLIAM,</p>

<p>Nothing should have prevented my answering your<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>{374}</span> kind letter from the
Cape, long ago, but the want of matter that seemed worth sending so far,
unless I confined myself to what you must he well assured of, my sincere
esteem and regard for yourself and Lady Gomm, and the expression of good
wishes for your health and happiness. I am still in the same difficulty,
but cannot defer writing longer, lest I should appear to myself unworthy
of your friendship or respect.</p>

<p>You describe the beauties of Rio Janeiro in glowing colours, and your
animated picture was rendered still more agreeable to me by the sight,
which I had enjoyed a little before, of a panorama of the same scene,
executed by a friend of mine, who in his youth studied at the Academy
with a view to practise painting as a profession. He was a very
promising young artist, but having a brother a Brazilian merchant, he
changed his purpose and went to Rio, where he resided many years, and
made a little fortune, which enabled him to purchase and build in
Cumberland, where I saw his splendid portrait of that magnificent
region. What an intricacy of waters, and what boldness and fantastic
variety in the mountains! I suppose, taking the region as a whole, it is
scarcely anywhere surpassed.</p>

<p>If the different quarters of the globe should ever become subject to one
empire, Rio ought to be the metropolis, it is so favoured in every
respect, and so admirably placed for intercourse with all the countries
of the earth. Your approach to the Cape was under awful circumstances,
and, with three great wrecks strewn along the coast of the bay, Lady
Gomm's spirit and fortitude, as described by you, are worthy of all
admiration, and I am sure she will sympathise with the verses I send, to
commemorate a noble exploit of one of her sex. The inhumanity with which
the shipwrecked were lately treated upon the French coast impelled me to
place in contrast the conduct of an English woman and her parents under
like circumstances, as it occurred some years ago. Almost immediately
after I had composed my tribute to the memory of <i>Grace Darling</i>, I
learnt that the Queen and Queen Dowager had both just subscribed towards
the erection of a monument to record her heroism, upon the spot that
witnessed it.</p>

<p>Of public news I say nothing, as you will hear everything from quarters
more worthy of attention. I hope all goes on to your satisfaction,
mainly so at least, in your new government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>{375}</span> and that the disposition
which you will have taken with you to benefit the people under your rule
has not been, nor is likely to be, frustrated in any vexatious or
painful degree.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went over to Keswick to attend the funeral of my excellent
friend, Mr. Southey. His genius and abilities are well known to the
world, and he was greatly valued for his generous disposition and moral
excellence. His illness was long and afflicting; his mind almost
extinguished years before the breath departed. Mr. Rogers I have not
been in communication with since I saw you in London, but be assured I
shall bear in memory your message, and deliver it, if he and I live to
meet again. And now, my dear Sir Wm., repeating the united best good
wishes of Mrs. W. and myself, for you and Lady Gomm, and for your safe
return to your own country, I remain, in the hope of hearing from you
again,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, March 27. 1843.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR MR. REED,<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You give me pleasure by the interest you take in the various passages in
which I speak of the poets, my contemporaries, who are no more: dear
Southey, one of the most eminent, is just added to the list. A few days
ago I went over to Keswick to attend his remains to their last earthly
abode. For upwards of three years his mental faculties have been in a
state of deplorable decay; and his powers of recognition, except very
rarely and but for a moment, have been, during more than half that
period, all but extinct. His bodily health was grievously impaired, and
his medical attendant says that he must have died long since but for the
very great strength of his natural constitution. As to his literary
remains, they must be very considerable, but, except his epistolary
correspondence, more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>{376}</span> less unfinished. His letters cannot but be very
numerous, and, if carefully collected and judiciously selected, will, I
doubt not, add greatly to his reputation. He had a fine talent for that
species of composition, and took much delight in throwing off his mind
in that way. Mr. Taylor, the dramatic author, is his literary executor.</p>

<p>Though I have written at great, and I fear tiresome, length, I will add
a few words upon the wish you express that I would pay a tribute to the
English poets of past ages, who never had the fame they are entitled to,
and have long been almost entirely neglected. Had this been suggested to
me earlier in life, or had it come into my thoughts, the thing in all
probability would have been done. At present I cannot hope it will; but
it may afford you some satisfaction to be told, that in the MS. poem
upon my poetic education there is a whole book, of about 600 lines,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
upon my obligations to writers of imagination, and chiefly the poets,
though I have not expressly named those to whom you allude, and for
whom, and many others of their age, I have a high respect.</p>

<p>The character of the schoolmaster, about whom you inquire, had, like the
'Wanderer,' in 'The Excursion,' a solid foundation in fact and reality,
but, like him, it was also, in some degree, a composition: I will not,
and need not, call it an invention&mdash;it was no such thing; but were I to
enter into details, I fear it would impair the effect of the whole upon
your mind; nor could I do it to my own satisfaction. I send you,
according to your wish, the additions to the 'Ecclesiastical Sonnets,'
and also the last poem from my pen. I threw it off two or three weeks
ago, being in a great measure impelled to it by the desire I felt to do
justice to the memory of a heroine, whose conduct presented, some time
ago, a striking contrast to the inhumanity with which our countrymen,
shipwrecked lately upon the French coast, have been treated.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Ever most faithfully yours,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">WM. WORDSWORTH.</span><br />
</p>

<p>I must request that 'Grace Darling' may not be reprinted. I should be
much obliged if you will have the enclosed Sonnets copied and sent to
Bishop Doane, who has not given me his address.</p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO THE RIGHT HON. EARL DE LA WARR, LORD CHAMBERLAIN.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Ambleside, April 1. 1843.</span><br />
<br />
MY LORD,<br />
</p>

<p>The recommendation made by your Lordship to the Queen, and graciously
approved by her Majesty, that the vacant office of Poet Laureate should
be offered to me, affords me high gratification. Sincerely am I sensible
of this honour; and let me be permitted to add, that the being deemed
worthy to succeed my lamented and revered friend, Mr. Southey, enhances
the pleasure I receive upon this occasion.</p>

<p>The appointment, I feel, however, imposes duties which, far advanced in
life as I am, I cannot venture to undertake, and therefore must beg
leave to decline the acceptance of an offer that I shall always remember
with no unbecoming pride.</p>

<p>Her Majesty will not, I trust, disapprove of a determination forced upon
me by reflections which it is impossible for me to set aside.</p>

<p>Deeply feeling the distinction conferred upon me, and grateful for the
terms in which your Lordship has made the communication,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">I have the honour to be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">My Lord,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Your Lordship's most, obedient humble servant,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">W.W.</span><br />
</p>

<p>[He thus communicates the particulars of the offer to Lady F. Bentinck:]</p>

<p>The Lord Chamberlain, in terms the most honourable, has, with the
Queen's approbation, offered me the vacant Laureateship. Had I been
several years younger I should have accepted the office with pride and
pleasure; but on Friday I shall enter, God willing, my 74th year, and on
account of so advanced an age I begged permission to decline it, not
venturing to undertake its duties. For though, as you are aware, the
formal task-work of New Year and Birthday Odes was abolished<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> when
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>{378}</span> appointment was given to Mr. Southey, he still considered himself
obliged in conscience to produce, and did produce, verses, some of very
great merit, upon important public occasions. He failed to do so upon
the Queen's Coronation, and I know that this omission caused him no
little uneasiness. The same might happen to myself upon some important
occasion, and I should be uneasy under the possibility; I hope,
therefore, that neither you nor Lord Lonsdale, nor any of my friends,
will blame me for what I have done.</p>

<p>I was slow to send copies of 'Grace Darling' about, except to female
friends, lest I should seem to attach too much importance to the
production, though it was on a subject which interested the whole
nation. But as the verses seem to have given general pleasure, I now
venture to send the enclosed copies, one for Mr. Colvill, and the other
for my old friend Mr. O'Callaghan, begging that you would present them
at your own convenience. With the best of good wishes, and every kind
and respectful remembrance to Lord Lonsdale, who we are happy to learn
is doing so well, and also not forgetting Miss Thompson, I remain, dear
Lady Frederick,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Most faithfully and affectionately yours,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">WM. WORDSWORTH.</span><br />
</p>

<p>[Wordsworth's letter did not, however, prevent the Lord Chamberlain from
pressing the offer upon him, with an assurance that the duties of
Laureate had not recently extended beyond the Annual Ode, and might in
his case be considered as merely nominal, and would not in any way
interfere with his repose and retirement.</p>

<p>The same post brought also the following letter:]</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">'Whitehall, April 3. 1843.</span><br />
<br />
'MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>'I hope you may be induced to reconsider your decision with regard to
the appointment of Poet Laureate.</p>

<p>'The offer was made to you by the Lord Chamberlain, with my entire
concurrence, not for the purpose of imposing on you any onerous or
disagreeable duties, but in order to pay you that tribute of respect
which is justly due to the first of living poets.</p>

<p>'The Queen entirely approved of the nomination, and there is one
unanimous feeling on the part of all who have heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>{379}</span> the proposal
(and it is pretty generally known), that there could not be a question
about the selection.</p>

<p>'Do not be deterred by the fear of any obligations which the appointment
may be supposed to imply. I will undertake that you shall have nothing
<i>required</i> from you.</p>

<p>'But as the Queen can select for this honourable appointment no one
whose claims for respect and honour, on account of eminence as a poet,
can be placed in competition with yours, I trust you will not longer
hesitate to accept it.</p>

<p>

MY LORD,<br />
</p>

<p>Being assured by your Lordship's letter and by one from Sir Robert Peel,
both received this day, that the appointment to the Laureateship is to
be considered merely honorary, the apprehensions which at first
compelled me to decline accepting the offer of that appointment are
entirely removed.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Peel has also done me the honour of uniting his wish with
that which your Lordship has urged in a manner most gratifying to my
feelings; so that, under these circumstances, and sanctioned as the
recommendation has been by her Majesty's gracious approval, it is with
unalloyed pleasure that I accept this high distinction.</p>

Lord Chamberlain to the same effect, and in a like spirit, I have
accepted, with unqualified pleasure, a distinction sanctioned by her

MY DEAR SIR WILLIAM,<br />
</p>

<p>The sight of your handwriting was very welcome, and not the less so
because your sister had led me to expect a letter from you.</p>

<p>The Laureateship was offered to me in the most flattering terms, by the
Lord Chamberlain, of course with the approbation of the Queen; but I
declined it on account of my advanced age. I then received a second
letter from his Lordship, urging my acceptance of it, and assuring me
that it was intended merely as an honorary distinction for the past,
without the smallest reference<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>{381}</span> to any service to be attached to it.
From Sir R. Peel I had also a letter to the same effect, and the
substance and manner of both were such that if I had still rejected the
offer, I should have been little at peace with my own mind.</p>

<p>Thank you for your translations. The longer poem<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> would have given
me more pain than pleasure, but for your addition, which sets all right.</p>

<p>The attack upon W.S.L. to which you allude was written by my son-in-law;
but without any sanction from me, much less encouragement; in fact I
knew nothing about it or the preceding article of Landor, that had
called it forth, till after Mr. Q.'s had appeared. He knew very well
that I should have disapproved of his condescending to notice anything
that a man so deplorably tormented by ungovernable passion as that
unhappy creature might eject. His character may be given in two or three
words: a mad-man, a bad-man, yet a man of genius, as many a mad-man is.
I have not eyesight to spare for Periodical Literature, so with
exception of a newspaper now and then, I never look into anything of the
kind, except some particular article may be recommended to me by a
friend upon whose judgment I can rely.</p>

<p>You are quite at liberty to print when and where you like any verses
which you may do me the honour of writing upon, or addressing to, me.</p>

<p>Your godson, his sister, and four brothers, are all doing well. He is a
very clever boy, and more than that, being of an original or rather
peculiar structure of intellect, and his heart appears to be not
inferior to his head, so that I trust he will as a man do you no
discredit.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Aug. 2. 1843.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR MR. REED,<br />
</p>

<p>A few days ago I received a letter from a countryman of yours, the Rev.
R.C. Waterston of Boston, communicating the intelligence of the death of
that admirable artist and amiable man, my old friend, Mr. Alston. Mr. W.
and I are not acquainted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>{382}</span> and therefore I take it very kindly that he
should have given me this melancholy information, with most interesting
particulars of the last few hours of the life of the deceased. He also
sent me a copy of verses addressed by himself to me, I presume some
little time ago, and printed in the 'Christian Souvenir.' You have
probably seen the lines, and, if so, I doubt not, you will agree with me
that they indicate a true feeling of the leading characteristics of my
poems. At least I am sure that I wished them such as he represents them
to be, too partially no doubt.</p>

<p>It would give me pleasure could I make this letter, so long due, more
worthy of perusal, by touching upon any topics of a public or private
nature that might interest you; but beyond the assurance which I can
give you, that I and mine are and have been in good health, I know not
where to find them. This Spring I have not left home for London, or
anywhere else; and during the progress of it and the Summer I have had
much pleasure in noting the flowers and blossoms, as they appeared and
disappeared successively; an occupation from which, at least with
reference to my own grounds, a residence in town for the three foregoing
Spring seasons cut me off. Though my health continues, thank God, to be
very good, and I am active as most men of my age, my strength for very
long walks among the mountains is of course diminishing; but, weak or
strong in body, I shall ever remain, in heart and mind,</p>

<p>MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>I am pleased to hear what you are about, but I am far too advanced in
life to venture upon anything so difficult to do as hymns of devotion.</p>

<p>The one of mine which you allude to is quite at your service; only I
could wish the first line of the fifth stanza to be altered thus:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">March 31. 1844.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR LADY FREDERICK,<br />
</p>

<p>We have known each other too long and too intimately for you not to be
well aware of the reasons why I have not earlier condoled with you upon
your bereavement.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> I feel it deeply, and sympathise with you as much
and as truly as you possibly could wish. I have also grieved for the
rest of your family<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>{384}</span> and household, and not the least for Miss Thompson,
whose faithful and strong attachment to your revered father I have, for
a long time, witnessed with delight and admiration. Through my kind
friend Mr. O'Brien I have heard of you both; and in his second letter he
informs me, to my great sorrow, that Miss Thompson has been exceedingly
ill. God grant that she may soon recover, as you both will stand in need
of all your bodily strength to support you under so sad a loss. But, how
much is there to be thankful for in every part of Lord Lonsdale's life
to its close! How gently was he dealt with in his last moments! and with
what fortitude and Christian resignation did he bear such pains as
attended his decline, and prepared the way for his quiet dissolution! Of
my own feelings upon this loss I shall content myself with saying, that
as long as I retain consciousness I shall cherish the memory of your
father, for his inestimable worth, and as one who honoured me with his
friendship, and who was to myself and my children the best benefactor.
The sympathy which I now offer, dear Lady Frederick, is shared by my
wife and my daughter, and my son William; and will be also participated
in by my elder son, when he hears of the sad event.</p>

<p>I wrote to Dr. Jackson<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> to inquire whether the funeral was to be
strictly private, and learnt from him that it is to be so; otherwise I
should not have deprived myself of the melancholy satisfaction of
attending. Accept, dear Lady Frederick, my best wishes; and be assured
of my prayers for your support; and believe me,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">1844.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In your last letter you speak so feelingly of the manner in which my
birthday (April 7) has been noticed, both privately in your country, and
somewhat publicly in my own neighbourhood, that I cannot forbear adding
a word or two upon the subject. It would have delighted you to see the
assemblage in front of our house, some dancing upon the gravel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>{385}</span>platform, old and young, as described in Goldsmith's travels; and
others, children, I mean, chasing each other upon the little plot of
lawn to which you descend by steps from the platform. We had music of
our own preparing; and two sets of casual itinerants, Italians and
Germans, came in successively, and enlivened the festivity. There were
present upwards of 300 children, and about 150 adults of both sexes and
all ages, the children in their best attire, and of that happy and, I
may say, beautiful race, which is spread over this highly-favoured
portion of England. The tables were tastefully arranged in the open
air<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>&mdash;oranges and gingerbread in piles decorated with evergreens and
Spring flowers; and all partook of tea, the young in the open air, and
the old within doors. I must own I wish that little commemorations of
this kind were more common among us. It is melancholy to think how
little that portion of the community which is quite at ease in their
circumstances have to do in a <i>social</i> way with the humbler classes.
They purchase commodities of them, or they employ them as labourers, or
they visit them in charity for the sake of supplying their most urgent
wants by alms-giving. But this, alas, is far from enough; one would wish
to see the rich mingle with the poor as much as may be upon a footing of
fraternal equality. The old feudal dependencies and relations are almost
gone from England, and nothing has yet come adequately to supply their
place. There are tendencies of the right kind here and there, but they
are rather accidental than aught that is established in general manners.
Why should not great land-owners look for a substitute for what is lost
of feudal paternity in the higher principles of christianised humanity
and humble-minded brotherhood? And why should not this extend to those
vast communities which crowd so many parts of England under one head, in
the different sorts of manufacture, which, for the want of it, are too
often the pests of the social state? We are, however, improving, and I
trust that the example set by some mill-owners will not fail to
influence others.</p>

<p>It gave me pleasure to be told that Mr. Keble's Dedication of his
'Praelectiones' had fallen in your way, and that you had been struck by
it.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>{386}</span>It is not for me to say how far I am entitled to the honour which he
has done me, but I can sincerely say that it has been the main scope of
my writings to do what he says I have accomplished. And where could I
find a more trustworthy judge?</p>

<p>What you advise in respect to a separate publication of my Church
Poetry, I have often turned in my own mind; but I have really done so
little in that way compared with the magnitude of the subject, that I
have not courage to venture on such a publication. Besides, it would
not, I fear, pay its expenses. The Sonnets were so published upon the
recommendation of a deceased nephew of mine, one of the first scholars
of Europe, and as good as he was learned. The volume did not, I believe,
clear itself, and a great part of the impression, though latterly
offered at a reduced price, still remains, I believe, in Mr. Moxon's
hands. In this country people who do not grudge laying out their money
for new publications on personal or fugitive interests, that every one
is talking about, are very unwilling to part with it for literature
which is unindebted to temporary excitement. If they buy such at all, it
must be in some form for the most part that has little to recommend it
but low price.</p>

<p>And now, my dear Sir, with many thanks for the trouble you have been at,
and affectionate wishes for your welfare,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Oct. 1. 1844.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR MONTAGU,<br />
</p>

<p>Absence from home has prevented my replying earlier to your letter,
which gave me much pleasure on many accounts, and particularly as I
learned from it that you are so industrious, and to such good effect. I
don't wonder at your mention of the friends whom we have lost by death.
Bowles the poet still lives, and Rogers&mdash;all that survive of the
poetical fraternity with whom I have had any intimacy. Southey,
Campbell, and Cary, are no more. Of my class-fellows and schoolfellows
very few remain; my <i>intimate</i> associates of my own <span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>{387}</span>college are all
gone long since. Myers my cousin, Terrot, Jones my fellow-traveller,
Fleming and his brother Raincock of Pembroke, Bishop Middleton of the
same college&mdash;it has pleased God that I should survive them all. Then
there are none left but Joseph Cottle of the many friends I made at
Bristol and in Somersetshire; yet we are only in our 75th year. But
enough of this sad subject; let us be resigned under all dispensations,
and thankful; for that is our duty, however difficult it may be to
perform it. I send you the lock of hair which you desired, white as
snow, and taken from a residue which is thinning rapidly.</p>

<p>You neither mention your own health nor Mrs. Montagu's; I conclude,
therefore, that both of you are doing well. Pray remember me kindly to
her; and believe me, my dear Montagu, your faithful and affectionate
friend,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Nov. 18. 1844.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR MR. REED,<br />
</p>

<p>Mrs. Wordsworth and I have been absent from home for a month past, and
we deferred acknowledging your acceptable letter till our return. Among
the places to which we went on visits to our friends was Cambridge,
where I was happy to learn that great improvement was going on among the
young men. They were become much more regular in their conduct, and
attentive to their duties. Our host was the master of Trinity College,
Dr. Whewell, successor to my brother, Dr. Wordsworth, who filled the
office for more than twenty years highly to his honour, and resigned
before he was disqualified by age, lest, as his years advanced, his
judgment might be impaired, and his powers become unfit for the
responsibility without his being aware of it. This, you will agree with
me, was a noble example: may it be followed by others!</p>

<p>On our return home we were detained two hours at Northampton by the vast
crowd assembled to greet the Queen on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>{388}</span> way to Burleigh House. Shouts
and ringing of bells there were in abundance; but these are things of
course. It did please us, however, greatly to see every village we
passed through for the space of twenty-two miles decorated with
triumphal arches, and every cottage, however humble, with its little
display of laurel boughs and flowers hung from the windows and over the
doors. The people, young and old, were all making it holiday, and the
Queen could not but be affected with these universal manifestations of
affectionate loyalty. As I have said, we were detained two hours, and I
much regret that it did not strike me at the moment to throw off my
feelings in verse, for I had ample time to have done so, and might,
perhaps, have contrived to present through some of the authorities the
tribute to my Royal Mistress. How must these words shock your republican
ears! But you are too well acquainted with mankind and their history not
to be aware that love of country can clothe itself in many shapes.</p>

<p>I need not say what pleasure it would give us to see you and Mrs. Reed
in our beautiful place of abode.</p>

<p>I have no wish to see the review of my poems to which you allude, nor
should I read it if it fell in my way. It is too late in life for me to
profit by censure, and I am indifferent to praise merely as such. Mrs.
Wordsworth will be happy to write her opinion of the portrait as you
request.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Rydal Mount, Ambleside, July 1. 1845.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR MR. REED,<br />
</p>

<p>I have, as usual, been long in your debt, which I am pretty sure you
will excuse as heretofore. It gave me much pleasure to have a glimpse of
your brother under circumstances which no doubt he will have described
to you. He spoke of his health as improved, and I hope it will continue
to do so. I understood from him that it was probable he should call at
Rydal before his return to his own country. I need not say to you I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>{389}</span>shall be glad, truly glad, to see him both for his own sake, and as so
nearly connected with you. My absence from home lately was not of more
than three weeks. I took the journey to London solely to pay my respects
to the Queen upon my appointment to the Laureateship upon the decease of
my friend Mr. Southey. The weather was very cold, and I caught an
inflammation in one of my eyes, which rendered my stay in the south very
uncomfortable. I nevertheless did, in respect to the object of my
journey, all that was required. The reception given me by the Queen at
her ball was most gracious. Mrs. Everett, the wife of your minister,
among many others, was a witness to it, without knowing who I was. It
moved her to the shedding of tears. This effect was in part produced, I
suppose, by American habits of feeling, as pertaining to a republican
government. To see a grey-haired man of seventy-five years of age,
kneeling down in a large assembly to kiss the hand of a young woman, is
a sight for which institutions essentially democratic do not prepare a
spectator of either sex, and must naturally place the opinions upon
which a republic is founded, and the sentiments which support it, in
strong contrast with a government based and upheld as ours is. I am not,
therefore, surprised that Mrs. Everett was moved, as she herself
described to persons of my acquaintance, among others to Mr. Rogers the
poet. By the by, of this gentleman, now I believe in his eighty-third
year, I saw more than of any other person except my host, Mr. Moxon,
while I was in London. He is singularly fresh and strong for his years,
and his mental faculties (with the exception of his memory a little) not
at all impaired. It is remarkable that he and the Rev. W. Bowles were
both distinguished as poets when I was a school-boy, and they have
survived almost all their eminent contemporaries, several of whom came
into notice long after them. Since they became known, Burns, Cowper,
Mason the author of 'Caractacus' and friend of Gray, have died. Thomas
Warton, Laureate, then Byron, Shelley, Keats, and a good deal later<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
Scott, Coleridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>{390}</span> Crabbe, Southey, Lamb, the Ettrick Shepherd, Cary the
translator of Dante, Crowe the author of 'Lewesdon Hill,' and others of
more or less distinction, have disappeared. And now of English poets,
advanced in life, I cannot recall any but James Montgomery, Thomas
Moore, and myself, who are living, except the octogenarian with whom I
began.</p>

<p>I saw Tennyson, when I was in London, several times. He is decidedly the
first of our living poets, and I hope will live to give the world still
better things. You will be pleased to hear that he expressed in the
strongest terms his gratitude to my writings. To this I was far from
indifferent, though persuaded that he is not much in sympathy with what
I should myself most value in my attempts, viz. the spirituality with
which I have endeavoured to invest the material universe, and the moral
relations under which I have wished to exhibit its most ordinary
appearances. I ought not to conclude this first portion of my letter
without telling you that I have now under my roof a cousin, who some
time ago was introduced, improperly, I think, she being then a child, to
the notice of the public, as one of the English poetesses, in an article
of the <i>Quarterly</i> so entitled. Her name is Emmeline Fisher, and her
mother is my first cousin. What advances she may have made in latter
years I do not know, but her productions from the age of eight to twelve
were not less than astonishing. She only arrived yesterday, and we
promise ourselves much pleasure in seeing more of her. Our dear friend
Miss Fenwick is also under our roof; so is Katharine Southey, her late
father's youngest daughter, so that we reckon ourselves rich; though our
only daughter is far from us, being gone to Oporto with her husband on
account of her enfeebled frame: and most unfortunately, soon after her
arrival, she was seized with a violent attack of rheumatic fever caused
by exposure to the evening air. We have also been obliged lately to part
with four grandsons, very fine boys, who are gone with their father to
Italy to visit their mother, kept there by severe illness, which sent
her abroad two years ago. Under these circumstances we old people keep
our spirits as well as we can, trusting the end to God's goodness.</p>

<p>Now, for the enclosed poem,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> which I wrote the other day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>{391}</span> and which
I send to you, hoping it may give you some pleasure, as a scanty
repayment for all that we owe you. Our dear friend, Miss Fenwick, is
especially desirous that her warmest thanks should be returned to you
for all the trouble you have taken about her bonds. But, to return to
the verses: if you approve, pray forward them with my compliments and
thanks for his letter to &mdash;&mdash;. In his letter he states that with others
he is strenuously exerting himself in endeavours to abolish slavery,
and, as one of the means of disposing the public mind to that measure,
he is about to publish selections from various authors in behalf of
<i>humanity</i>. He begs an original composition from me. I have nothing
bearing directly upon slavery, but if you think this little piece would
serve his cause indirectly, pray be so kind as to forward it to him. He
speaks of himself as deeply indebted to my writings.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Brinsop Court, Sept. 27 [1845].</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR MR. REED,<br />
</p>

<p>The sight of your letter was very welcome, and its contents proved most
agreeable. It was well that you did not forward my little poem to the
party, he entertaining the opinions he holds, and being of the character
you describe. I shall therefore be gratified if you, as you propose,
write him a note, expressing that I have nothing among my MSS. that
would suit his purpose. The verses are already printed in the new
edition of my poems (double column), which is going through the press.
It will contain about 300 verses not found in the previous edition. I do
not remember whether I have mentioned to you that, following your
example, I have greatly extended the class entitled 'Poems of the
Imagination,' thinking, as you must have done, that if imagination were
predominant in the class, it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>{392}</span> indispensable that it should
pervade every poem which it contained. Limiting the class as I had done
before seemed to imply, and to the uncandid or unobserving it did so,
that the faculty, which is the <i>primum mobile</i> in poetry, had little to
do, in the estimation of the author, with the pieces not arranged under
that head. I, therefore, feel much obliged to you for suggesting by your
practice the plan which I have adopted. In respect to the Prefaces, my
own wish would be that now the Poems should be left to speak for
themselves without them; but I know that this would not answer for the
purposes of sale. They will, therefore, be printed at the end of the
volume; and to this I am in some degree reconciled by the matter they
contain relating to poetry in general, and the principles they
inculcate. I hope that, upon the whole, the edition will please you. In
a very few instances I have altered the expression for the worse, on
account of the same feeling or word occurring rather too near the
passage. For example, the Sonnet on Baptism begins '<i>Blest</i> be the
Church.' But unfortunately the word occurs some three or four lines just
before or after; I have, therefore, though reluctantly, substituted the
less impressive word, '<i>Dear</i> be the Church.' I mention this solely to
prevent blame on your part in this and a few similar cases where an
injurious change has been made. The book will be off my hands I hope in
about two weeks.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mrs. Wordsworth and I left home four days ago, and do not intend to
return, if all goes well, in less than five or six weeks from this time.
We purpose in our way home to visit York, the cathedral of which city
has been restored; and then we shall go to Leeds, on a visit to our
friend Mr. James Marshall, in full expectation that we shall be highly
delighted by the humane and judicious manner in which his manufactory is
managed, and by inspecting the schools which he and his brother have
established and superintended. We also promise ourselves much pleasure
from the sight of the magnificent church, which, upon the foundation of
the old parish church of that town, has been built through the exertions
and by the munificence of the present incumbent, that excellent and able
man Dr. Hook, whom I have the honour of reckoning among my friends.</p>

<p>This letter is written by the side of my brother-in-law, who, eight
years ago, became a cripple, confined to his chair, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>{393}</span> accident of
his horse falling with him in the high road, where he lay without power
to move either hand or leg, but left in perfect possession of his
faculties. His bodily sufferings are by this time somewhat abated, but
they still continue severe. His patience and cheerfulness are so
admirable that I could not forbear mentioning him to you. He is an
example to us all; and most undeserving should we be if we did not
profit by it. His family have lately succeeded in persuading him to have
his portrait taken as he sits in his arm-chair. It is an excellent
likeness, one of the best I ever saw, and will be invaluable to his
family. This reminds me of Mr. Inman and a promise which he made that he
would send us a copy of your portrait of myself. I say a promise, though
it scarcely amounted to that absolutely, but it was little short of it.
Do you think he could find time to act upon his own wish in this matter?
in which I feel interested on Mrs. Wordsworth's account, who reckons
that portrait much the best both as to likeness and execution of all
that have been made of me, and she is an excellent judge. In adverting
to this subject, I of course presume that you would have no objection to
the picture being copied if the artist were inclined to do it.</p>

<p>My paper admonishes me that I must conclude. Pray let me know in your
next how Mrs. Reed and your family are in health, and present my good
wishes to her.</p>

MY DEAR C&mdash;&mdash;,<br />
</p>

<p>I ought to have acknowledged my debt to you long ago, but the
inflammation in one of my eyes which seized me on my first arrival in
London kept its ground for a long time. I had your two first pamphlets
read to me, and immediately put them into circulation among my friends
in this neighbourhood; but wishing to read them myself I did not like to
write to you till I had done so, as there were one or two passages on
which I wished to make a remark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>{394}</span></p>

<p>As to your arguments, they are unanswerable, and the three tracts do you
the greatest possible credit; but the torrent cannot be stemmed, unless
we can construct a body, I will not call it a party, upon a new and true
principle of action, as you have set forth. Certain questions are forced
by the present conduct of government upon the mind of every observing
and thinking person. First and foremost, are we to have a <i>national</i>
English Church, or is the Church of England to be regarded merely as a
sect? and is the <i>right to the Throne to be put on a new foundation</i>? Is
the present ministry prepared for this, and all that must precede and
follow it? Is Ireland an integral and inseparable portion of the Empire
or not? If it be, I cannot listen to the argument in favour of endowing
Romanism upon the ground of superiority of <i>numbers</i>. The Romanists are
not a majority in England and Ireland, taken, as they ought to be,
together. As to Scotland, it has its separate kirk by especial covenant.
Are the ministers prepared to alter fundamentally the basis of the Union
between England and Ireland, and to construct a new one? If they be, let
them tell us so at once. In short, they are involving themselves and the
Nation in difficulties from which there is no escape&mdash;for them at least
none. What I have seen of your letter to Lord John M&mdash;&mdash; I like as well
as your two former tracts, and I shall read it carefully at my first
leisure moment.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

MY DEAR OLD FRIEND,<br />
</p>

<p>Now for your little tract, 'Heresiarch Church of Rome.' I have perused
it carefully, and go the whole length with you in condemnation of
Romanism, and probably <i>much further</i>, by reason of my having passed at
least three years of life in countries where Romanism was the prevailing
or exclusive religion; and if we are to trust the declaration 'By their
fruits ye shall know them,' I have stronger reasons, in the privilege I
have named, for passing a severe condemnation upon leading parts of
their faith, and courses of their practice, than others<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>{395}</span> who have never
been eye-witnesses of the evils to which I allude. Your little
publication is well timed, and will I trust have such an effect as you
aimed at upon the minds of its readers.</p>

<p>And now let me bid you affectionately good bye, with assurance that I do
and shall retain to the last a remembrance of your kindness, and of the
many pleasant and happy hours which, at one of the most interesting
periods of my life, I passed in your neighbourhood, and in your company.</p>

<br />
MY DEAR MR. REED,<br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I hope to be able to send you an impression of an engraving, from a
picture of Mr. Haydon, representing me in the act of climbing Helvellyn.
There is great merit in this work, and the sight of it will show my
meaning on the subject of <i>expression</i>. This, I think, is attained; but,
then, I am stooping, and the inclination of the head necessarily causes
a foreshortening of the features below the nose, which takes from the
likeness accordingly; so that, upon the whole, yours has the advantage,
especially under the circumstance of your never having seen the
original. Mrs. Wordsworth has been looking over your letters in vain to
find the address of the person in London, through whose hands any parcel
for you might be sent. Pray take the trouble of repeating the address in
your next letter, and your request shall be attended to of sending you
my two letters upon the offensive subject of a Railway to and through
our beautiful neighbourhood.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You will be sorry to hear that Mrs. Wordsworth and I have been, and
still are, under great trouble and anxiety. Our daughter-in-law fell
into bad health between three and four years ago. She went with her
husband to Madeira, where they remained nearly a year; she was then
advised to go to Italy. After a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>{396}</span> prolonged residence there, her six
children, whom her husband returned to England for, went, at her earnest
request, to that country, under their father's guidance: there he was
obliged, on account of his duty as a clergyman, to leave them. Four of
the number resided with their mother at Rome, three of whom took a fever
there, of which the youngest, as noble a boy, of nearly five years, as
ever was seen, died, being seized with convulsions when the fever was
somewhat subdued. The father, in a distracted state of mind, is just
gone back to Italy; and we are most anxious to hear the result. My only
surviving brother, also, the late Master of Trinity College, Cambridge,
and an inestimable person, is in an alarming state of health; and the
only child of my eldest brother, long since deceased, is now languishing
under mortal illness at Ambleside. He was educated to the medical
profession, and caught his illness while on duty in the Mediterranean.
He is a truly amiable and excellent young man, and will be universally
regretted. These sad occurrences, with others of like kind, have thrown
my mind into a state of feeling, which the other day vented itself in
the two sonnets which Mrs. Wordsworth will transcribe as the best
acknowledgment she can make for Mrs. Reed's and your kindness.</p>

<div class="center">LETTER TO PROFESSOR REED.</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">February 3. 1846.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR MR. REED,<br />
</p>

<p>I was much shocked to find that my last had been despatched without
acknowledgment for your kindness in sending me the admirable engraving
of Bishop White, which I was delighted, on many accounts, to receive.
This omission was owing to the distressed state of mind in which I
wrote, and which I throw myself on your goodness to excuse. I ought to
have written again by next post, but we really have been, and still are,
in such trouble from various causes, that I could not take up the pen,
and now must beg you to accept this statement as the only excuse which I
can offer. We have had such <span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>{397}</span>accounts from my daughter-in-law at Rome,
that her mother and brother are just gone thither to support her, her
mother being seventy years of age.</p>

<p>Do you know anything of a wretched set of religionists in your country,
<i>Superstitionists</i> I ought to say, called Mormonites, or latter-day
saints? Would you believe it? a niece of Mrs. Wordsworth's has just
embarked, we believe at Liverpool, with a set of the deluded followers
of that wretch, in an attempt to join their society. Her name is &mdash;&mdash;, a
young woman of good abilities and well educated, but early in life she
took from her mother and her connections a methodistical turn, and has
gone on in a course of what she supposes to be piety till she has come
to this miserable close. If you should by chance hear anything about
her, pray let us know.</p>

<p>The report of my brother's decease, which we look for every day, has not
yet reached us. My nephew is still lingering on from day to day.</p>

<br />
DEAR SIR WILLIAM,<br />
</p>

<p>Your kind letter of the 4th of August I have just received; and I thank
you sincerely for this mark of your attention, and for the gratification
it afforded me. It is pleasing to see fancy amusements giving birth to
works of solid profit, as, under the auspices of Lady Gomm, they are
doing in your island.</p>

<p>Your sonnet addressed to the unfinished monument of Governor Malartie is
conceived with appropriate feeling and just discrimination. Long may the
finished monument last as a tribute to departed worth, and as a check
and restraint upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>{398}</span>intemperate desires for change, to which the
inhabitants of the island may hereafter be liable!</p>

<p>Before this letter reaches you the newspapers will probably have told
you that I have been recently put in nomination, unknown to myself, for
the high office of Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow; and that
there was a majority of twenty-one votes in my favour, in opposition to
the premier, Lord John Russell. The forms of the election, however,
allowed Lord John Russell to be returned, through the single vote of the
sub-rector voting for his superior. To say the truth, I am glad of this
result; being too advanced in life to undertake with comfort any
considerable public duty, and it might have seemed ungracious to decline
the office.</p>

<p>Men of rank, or of high station, with the exception of the poet
Campbell, who was, I believe, educated at this university, have almost
invariably been chosen for a rector of this ancient university; and that
another exception was made in my favour by a considerable majority
affords a proof that literature, independent of office, does not want
due estimation. I should not have dwelt so long upon this subject, had
anything personal to myself occurred in which you could have taken
interest.</p>

<p>As you do not mention your own health, or that of Lady Gomm, I infer
with pleasure that the climate agrees with you both. That this may
continue to be so is my earnest and sincere wish, in which Mrs.
Wordsworth cordially unites.</p>

MY DEAR FRIEND,<br />
</p>

<p>Mrs. Wordsworth has deputed to me the acceptable office of answering
your friendly letter, which has followed us to Brigham, upon the banks
of the river Derwent, near Cockermouth, the birthplace of four brothers
and their sister. Of these four, I, the second, am now the only one
left. Am I wrong in supposing that you have been here? The house was
driven out of its place by a railway, and stands now nothing like so
advantageously for a prospect of this beautiful country, though at only
a small distance from its former situation.</p>

<p>We are expecting Mr. Cuthbert Southey to-day, from his curacy, seven or
eight miles distant. He is busy in carrying through the press the first
volume of his father's letters, or rather, collecting and preparing them
for it. Do you happen to have any in your possession? If so, be so kind
as to let me or his son know what they are, if you think they contain
anything which would interest the public.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mrs. W. and I are, thank God, both in good health, and possessing a
degree of strength beyond what is usual at our age, being both in our
seventy-ninth year. The beloved daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>{400}</span> whom it has pleased God to
remove from this anxious and sorrowful world, I have not mentioned; but
I can judge of the depth of your fellow-feeling for us. Many thanks to
you for referring to the text in Scripture which I quoted to you so long
ago.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> 'Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done.' He who does not find
support and consolation there, will find it nowhere. God grant that it
may he continued to me and mine, and to all sufferers! Believe me, with
Mrs. W.'s very kind remembrance,</p>

<p>Our anxieties are over, and our sorrow is not without heartfelt, I may
say heavenly, consolation. Dear, and good, and faithful, and dutiful
Jane breathed her last about twelve o'clock last night. The doctor had
seen her at noon; he found her much weaker. She said to him, 'I cannot
stand now,' but he gave us no reason to believe her end was so very
near. You shall hear all particulars when we are permitted to meet,
which God grant may be soon. Nothing could be more gentle than her
departure.</p>

<p>Writing to a friend, he says: 'I feel myself in so many respects
unworthy of your love, and too likely to become more so.' (This was in
1844.) 'Worldly-minded I am not; on the contrary, my wish to benefit
those within my humble sphere strengthens seemingly in exact proportion
to my inability to realise those wishes. What I lament most is, that the
spirituality of my nature does not expand and rise the nearer I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>{401}</span>approach the grave, as yours does, and as it fares with my beloved
partner. The pleasure which I derive from God's works in His visible
creation is not with me, I think, impaired, but reading does not
interest me as it used to do, and I feel that I am becoming daily a less
instructive companion to others. Excuse this egotism. I feel it
necessary to your understanding what I am, and how little you would gain
by habitual intercourse with me, however greatly I might benefit from
intercourse with you.'<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>No little fish thrown back again into the water, no fly unimprisoned
from a child's hand, could more buoyantly enjoy its element, than I this
clean and peaceful house, with this lovely view of the town, groves, and
lake of Ratzeburg, from the window at which I am writing. My spirits
certainly, and my health I fancied, were beginning to sink under the
noise, dirt, and unwholesome air of our Hamburg hotel. I left it on
Sunday, Sept. 23rd. with a letter of introduction from the poet
Klopstock, to the <i>Amtmann</i> of Ratzeburg. The <i>Amtmann</i> received me with
kindness, and introduced me to the worthy pastor, who agreed to board
and lodge me for any length of time not less than a month. The vehicle,
in which I took my place, was considerably larger than an English
stage-coach, to which it bore much the same proportion and rude
resemblance, that an elephant's ear does to the human. Its top was
composed of naked boards of different colours, and seeming to have been
parts of different wainscots. Instead of windows there were leathern
curtains with a little eye of glass in each: they perfectly answered the
purpose of keeping out the prospect and letting in the cold. I could
observe little, therefore, but the inns and farm-houses at which we
stopped. They were all alike, except in size: one great room, like a
barn, with a hay-loft over it, the straw and hay dangling in tufts
through the boards which formed the ceiling of the room, and the floor
of the loft. From this room, which is paved like a street, sometimes
one, sometimes two smaller ones, are enclosed at one end. These are
commonly floored. In the large room the cattle, pigs, poultry, men,
women, and children, live in amicable community: yet there was an
appearance of cleanliness and rustic comfort. One of these houses I
measured. It was an hundred feet in length. The apartments were taken
off from one corner. Between these and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>{406}</span> the stalls there was a small
interspace, and here the breadth was forty-eight feet, but thirty-two
where the stalls were; of course, the stalls were on each side eight
feet in depth. The faces of the cows &amp;c. were turned towards the room;
indeed they were in it, so that they had at least the comfort of seeing
each other's faces. Stall-feeding is universal in this part of Germany,
a practice concerning which the agriculturist and the poet are likely to
entertain opposite opinions&mdash;or at least, to have very different
feelings. The wood-work of these buildings on the outside is left
unplastered, as in old houses among us, and, being painted red and
green, it cuts and tesselates the buildings very gaily. From within
three miles of Hamburg almost to Molln, which is thirty miles from it,
the country, as far as I could see it was a dead flat, only varied by
woods. At Molln it became more beautiful. I observed a small lake nearly
surrounded with groves, and a palace in view belonging to the King of
Great Britain, and inhabited by the Inspector of the Forests. We were
nearly the same time in travelling the thirty-five miles from Hamburg to
Ratzeburg, as we had been in going from London to Yarmouth, one hundred
and twenty-six miles.</p>

<p>The lake of Ratzeburg runs from south to north, about nine miles in
length, and varying in breadth from three miles to half a mile. About a
mile from the southernmost point it is divided into two, of course very
unequal, parts by an island, which, being connected by a bridge and a
narrow slip of land with the one shore, and by another bridge of immense
length with the other shore, forms a complete isthmus. On this island
the town of Ratzeburg is built. The pastor's house or vicarage, together
with the <i>Amtmann's, Amtsschreiber's</i>, and the church, stands near the
summit of a hill, which slopes down to the slip of land and the little
bridge, from which, through a superb military gate, you step into the
island-town of Ratzeburg. This again is itself a little hill, by
ascending and descending which, you arrive at the long bridge, and so to
the other shore. The water to the south of the town is called the Little
Lake, which however almost engrosses the beauties of the whole: the
shores being just often enough green and bare to give the proper effect
to the magnificent groves which occupy the greater part of their
circumference. From the turnings, windings, and indentations of the
shore, the views vary almost every ten steps, and the whole has a sort
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>{407}</span> majestic beauty, a feminine grandeur. At the north of the Great
Lake, and peeping over it, I see the seven church towers of Lubec, at
the distance of twelve or thirteen miles, yet as distinctly as if they
were not three. The only defect in the view is, that Ratzeburg is built
entirely of red bricks, and all the houses roofed with red tiles. To the
eye, therefore, it presents a clump of brick-dust red. Yet this evening,
Oct. 10th. twenty minutes past five, I saw the town perfectly beautiful,
and the whole softened down into <i>complete keeping</i>, if I may borrow a
term from the painters. The sky over Ratzeburg and all the east was a
pure evening blue, while over the west it was covered with light sandy
clouds. Hence a deep red light spread over the whole prospect, in
undisturbed harmony with the red town, the brown-red woods, and the
yellow-red reeds on the skirts of the lake. Two or three boats, with
single persons paddling them, floated up and down in the rich light,
which not only was itself in harmony with all, but brought all into
harmony.</p>

<p>I should have told you that I went back to Hamburg on Thursday (Sept.
27th.) to take leave of my friend, who travels southward, and returned
hither on the Monday following. From Empfelde, a village half way from
Ratzeburg, I walked to Hamburg through deep sandy roads and a dreary
flat: the soil everywhere white, hungry, and excessively pulverised; but
the approach to the city is pleasing. Light cool country houses, which
you can look through and see the gardens behind them, with arbours and
trellis work, and thick vegetable walls, and trees in cloisters and
piazzas, each house with neat rails before it, and green seats within
the rails. Every object, whether the growth of Nature or the work of
man, was neat and artificial. It pleased me far better, than if the
houses and gardens, and pleasure fields, had been in a nobler taste: for
this nobler taste would have been mere apery. The busy, anxious,
money-loving merchant of Hamburg could only have adopted, he could not
have enjoyed the simplicity of Nature. The mind begins to love Nature by
imitating human conveniences in Nature; but this is a step in intellect,
though a low one&mdash;and were it not so, yet all around me spoke of
innocent enjoyment and sensitive comforts, and I entered with
unscrupulous sympathy into the enjoyments and comforts even of the busy,
anxious, money-loving merchants of Hamburg. In this charitable and
<i>catholic</i> mood I reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>{408}</span> vast ramparts of the city. These are huge
green cushions, one rising above the other, with trees growing in the
interspaces, pledges and symbols of a long peace. Of my return I have
nothing worth communicating, except that I took extra post, which
answers to posting in England. These north German post chaises are
uncovered wicker carts. An English dust-cart is a piece of finery, a
<i>chef d'oeuvre</i> of mechanism, compared with them: and the horses!&mdash;a
savage might use their ribs instead of his fingers for a numeration
table. Wherever we stopped, the postilion fed his cattle with the brown
rye bread of which he eat himself, all breakfasting together; only the
horses had no gin to their water, and the postilion no water to his gin.
Now and henceforward for subjects of more interest to you, and to the
objects in search of which I loft you: namely, the <i>literati</i> and
literature of Germany.</p>

<p>Believe me, I walked with an impression of awe on my spirits, as W&mdash;&mdash;
and myself accompanied Mr. Klopstock to the house of his brother, the
poet, which stands about a quarter of a mile from the city gate. It is
one of a row of little common-place summer-houses, (for so they looked,)
with four or five rows of young meagre elm trees before the windows,
beyond which is a green, and then a dead flat intersected with several
roads. Whatever beauty, (thought I,) may be before the poet's eyes at
present, it must certainly be purely of his own creation. We waited a
few minutes in a neat little parlour, ornamented with the figures of two
of the Muses and with prints, the subjects of which were from
Klopstock's odes.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>{409}</span></p>

<p>The poet entered. I was much disappointed in his countenance, and
recognised in it no likeness to the bust. There was no comprehension in
the forehead, no weight over the eye-brows, no expression of
peculiarity, moral or intellectual, on the eyes, no massiveness in the
general countenance. He is, if anything, rather below the middle size.
He wore very large half-boots, which his legs filled, so fearfully were
they swollen. However, though neither W&mdash;&mdash; nor myself could discover
any indications of sublimity or enthusiasm in his physiognomy, we were
both equally impressed with his liveliness, and his kind and ready
courtesy. He talked in French with my friend, and with difficulty spoke
a few sentences to me in English. His enunciation was not in the least
affected by the entire want of his upper teeth. The conversation began
on his part by the expression of his rapture at the surrender of the
detachment of French troops under General Humbert. Their proceedings in
Ireland with regard to the committee which they had appointed, with the
rest of their organizing system, seemed to have given the poet great
entertainment. He then declared his sanguine belief in Nelson's victory,
and anticipated its confirmation with a keen and triumphant pleasure.
His words, tones, looks, implied the most vehement Anti-Gallicanism. The
subject changed to literature, and I inquired in Latin concerning the
history of German poetry and the elder German poets. To my great
astonishment he confessed, that he knew very little on the subject. He
had indeed occasionally read one or two of their elder writers, but not
so as to enable him to speak of their merits. Professor Ebeling, he
said, would probably give me every information of this kind: the subject
had not particularly excited his curiosity. He then talked of Milton and
Glover, and thought Glover's blank verse superiour to Milton's.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>{410}</span>W&mdash;&mdash; and myself expressed our surprise: and my friend gave his
definition and notion of harmonious verse, that it consisted, (the
English iambic blank verse above all,) in the apt arrangement of pauses
and cadences, and the sweep of whole paragraphs,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&mdash;&mdash;'with many a winding bout<br /></span>
<span>Of linked sweetness long drawn out,'<br /></span>
</div></div>
and not in the even flow, much less in the prominence or antithetic
vigour, of single lines, which were indeed injurious to the total
effect, except where they were introduced for some specific purpose.
Klopstock assented, and said that he meant to confine Glover's
superiority to single lines.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>{411}</span>He told us that he had read Milton, in a prose translation, when he was
fourteen.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> I understood him thus myself, and W&mdash;- interpreted
Klopstock's French as I had already construed it. He appeared to know
very little of Milton or indeed of our poets in general. He spoke with
great indignation of the English prose translation of his MESSIAH. All
the translations had been bad, very bad&mdash;but the English was <i>no</i>
translation&mdash;there were pages on pages not in the original: and half the
original was not to be found in the translation. W&mdash;- told him that I
intended to translate a few of his odes as specimens of German
lyrics&mdash;he then said to me in English, 'I wish you would render into
English some select passages of THE MESSIAH, and <i>revenge</i> me of your
countryman!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>{412}</span></p>

<p>It was the liveliest thing which he produced in the whole conversation.
He told us, that his first ode was fifty years older than his last. I
looked at him with much emotion&mdash;I considered him as the venerable
father of German poetry; as a good man as a Christian; seventy-four
years old; with legs enormously swollen; yet active, lively, cheerful,
and kind, and communicative. My eyes felt as if a tear were swelling
into them. In the portrait of Lessing there was a toupee periwig, which
enormously injured the effect of his physiognomy&mdash;Klopstock wore the
same, powdered and frizzled. By the bye, old men ought never to wear
powder&mdash;the contrast between a large snow-white wig and the colour of an
old man's skin is disgusting, and wrinkles in such a neighbourhood
appear only channels for dirt. It is an honour to poets and great men,
that you think of them as parts of Nature; and anything of trick and
fashion wounds you in them, as much as when you see venerable yews
clipped into miserable peacocks.&mdash;The author of THE MESSIAH should have
worn his own grey hair.&mdash;His powder and periwig were to the eye what
<i>Mr</i>. Virgil would be to the ear.</p>

<p>Klopstock dwelt much on the superiour power which the German language
possessed of concentrating meaning. He said, he had often translated
parts of Homer and Virgil, line by line, and a German line proved always
sufficient for a Greek or Latin one. In English you cannot do this. I
answered, that in English we could commonly render one Greek heroic line
in a line and a half of our common heroic metre, and I conjectured that
this line and a half would be found to contain no more syllables than
one German or Greek hexameter. He did not understand me:<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and I, who
wished to hear his opinions, not to correct them, was glad that he did
not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>{413}</span></p>

<p>We now took our leave. At the beginning of the French Revolution
Klopstock wrote odes of congratulation. He received some honorary
presents from the French Republic, (a golden crown I believe,) and, like
our Priestley, was invited to a seat in the legislature, which he
declined. But when French liberty metamorphosed herself into a fury, he
sent back these presents with a <i>palinodia</i>, declaring his abhorrence of
their proceedings: and since then he has been perhaps more than enough
an Anti-Gallican. I mean, that in his just contempt and detestation of
the crimes and follies of the Revolutionists, he suffers himself to
forget that the revolution itself is a process of the Divine Providence;
and that as the folly of men is the wisdom of God, so are their
iniquities instruments of his goodness. From Klopstock's house we walked
to the ramparts, discoursing together on the poet and his conversation,
till our attention was diverted to the beauty and singularity of the
sunset and its effects on the objects around us. There were woods in the
distance. A rich sandy light, (nay, of a much deeper colour than sandy,)
lay over these woods that blackened in the blaze. Over that part of the
woods which lay immediately under the intenser light, a brassy mist
floated. The trees on the ramparts, and the people moving to and fro
between them, were cut or divided into equal segments of deep shade and
brassy light. Had the trees, and the bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>{414}</span> of the men and women, been
divided into equal segments by a rule or pair of compasses, the portions
could not have been more regular. All else was obscure. It was a fairy
scene!&mdash;and to increase its romantic character, among the moving
objects, thus divided into alternate shade and brightness, was a
beautiful child, dressed with the elegant simplicity of an English
child, riding on a stately goat, the saddle, bridle, and other
accoutrements of which were in a high degree costly and splendid. Before
I quit the subject of Hamburg, let me say, that I remained a day or two
longer than I otherwise should have done, in order to be present at the
feast of St. Michael, the patron saint of Hamburg, expecting to see the
civic pomp of this commercial Republic. I was however disappointed.
There were no processions, two or three sermons were preached to two or
three old women in two or three churches, and St. Michael and his
patronage wished elsewhere by the higher classes, all places of
entertainment, theatre, &amp;c. being shut up on this day. In Hamburg, there
seems to be no religion at all; in Lubec it is confined to the women.
The men seem determined to be divorced from their wives in the other
world, if they cannot in this. You will not easily conceive a more
singular sight, than is presented by the vast aisle of the principal
church at Lubec seen from the organ-loft: for, being filled with female
servants and persons in the same class of life, and all their caps
having gold and silver cauls, it appears like a rich pavement of gold
and silver.</p>

<p>I will conclude this letter with the mere transcription of notes, which
my friend W&mdash;&mdash; made of his conversations with Klopstock, during the
interviews that took place after my departure. On these I shall make but
one remark at present, and that will appear a presumptuous one, namely,
that Klopstock's remarks on the venerable sage of K&ouml;nigsburg are to my
own knowledge injurious and mistaken; and so far is it from being true,
that his system is now given up, that throughout the Universities of
Germany there is not a single professor who is not either a Kantean or a
disciple of Fichte, whose system is built on the Kantean, and
presupposes its truth; or lastly who, though an antagonist of Kant, as
to his theoretical work, has not embraced wholly or in part his moral
system, and adopted part of his nomenclature. 'Klopstock having wished
to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>{415}</span> CALVARY of Cumberland, and asked what was thought of it in
England, I went to Remnant's (the English bookseller) where I procured
the Analytical Review, in which is contained the review of Cumberland's
CALVARY. I remembered to have read there some specimens of a blank verse
translation of THE MESSIAH. I had mentioned this to Klopstock, and he
had a great desire to see them. I walked over to his house and put the
book into his hands. On adverting to his own poem, he told me he began
THE MESSIAH when he was seventeen: he devoted three entire years to the
plan without composing a single line. He was greatly at a loss in what
manner to execute his work. There were no successful specimens of
versification in the German language before this time. The first three
cantos he wrote in a species of measured or numerous prose. This, though
done with much labour and some success, was far from satisfying him. He
had composed hexameters both Latin and Greek as a school exercise, and
there had been also in the German language attempts in that style of
versification. These were only of very moderate merit.&mdash;One day he was
struck with the idea of what could be done in this way&mdash;he kept his room
a whole day, even went without his dinner, and found that in the evening
he had written twenty-three hexameters, versifying a part of what he had
before written in prose. From that time, pleased with his efforts, he
composed no more in prose. To-day he informed me that he had finished
his plan before he read Milton. He was enchanted to see an author who
before him had trod the same path. This is a contradiction of what he
said before. He did not wish to speak of his poem to any one till it was
finished: but some of his friends who had seen what he had finished,
tormented him till he had consented to publish a few books in a journal.
He was then, I believe, very young, about twenty-five. The rest was
printed at different periods, four books at a time. The reception given
to the first specimens was highly flattering. He was nearly thirty years
in finishing the whole poem, but of these thirty years not more than two
were employed in the composition. He only composed in favourable
moments; besides he had other occupations. He values himself upon the
plan of his odes, and accuses the modern lyrical writers of gross
deficiency in this respect. I laid the same accusation against Horace:
he would not hear of it&mdash;but waived the discussion. He called<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>{416}</span>
Rousseau's ODE TO FORTUNE a moral dissertation in stanzas.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> I spoke
of Dryden's ST. CECILIA; but be did not seem familiar with our writers.
He wished to know the distinctions between our dramatic and epic blank
verse.</p>

<p>He recommended me to read his HERMANN before I read either THE MESSIAH
or the odes. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>{417}</span>He flattered himself that some time or other his dramatic
poems would be known in England. He had not heard of Cowper. He thought
that Voss in his translation of THE ILIAD had done violence to the idiom
of the Germans, and had sacrificed it to the Greeks, not remembering
sufficiently that each language has its particular spirit and
genius.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> He said Lessing was the first of their dramatic writers. I
complained of NATHAN as tedious. He said there was not enough of action
in it; but that Lessing was the most chaste of their writers. He spoke
favourably of Goethe; but said that his SORROWS OF WERTER was his best
work, better than any of his dramas: he preferred the first written to
the rest of Goethe's dramas. Schiller's ROBBERS he found so extravagant,
that he could not read it. I spoke of the scene of the setting sun.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
He did not know it. He said Schiller could not live. He thought DON
CARLOS the best of his dramas; but said that the plot was
inextricable.&mdash;It was evident he knew little of Schiller's works:
indeed, he said, he could not read them. B&uuml;rger, he said, was a true
poet, and would live; that Schiller, on the contrary, must soon be
forgotten; that he gave himself up to the imitation of Shakespeare, who
often was extravagant, but that Schiller was ten thousand times more
so.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>{418}</span></p>

<p>He spoke very slightingly of Kotzebue, as an immoral author in the
first place, and next, as deficient in power. At Vienna, said he, they
are transported with him; but we do not reckon the people of Vienna
either the wisest or the wittiest people of Germany. He said Wieland was
a charming author, and a sovereign master of his own language: that in
this respect Goethe could not be compared to him, nor indeed could any
body else. He said that his fault was to be fertile to exuberance. I
told him the OBERON had just been translated into English. He asked me
if I was not delighted with the poem. I answered, that I thought the
story began to flag about the seventh or eighth book; and observed, that
it was unworthy of a man of genius to make the interest of a long poem
turn entirely upon animal gratification. He seemed at first disposed to
excuse this by saying, that there are different subjects for poetry, and
that poets are not willing to be restricted in their choice. I answered,
that I thought the <i>passion</i> of love as well suited to the purposes of
poetry as any other passion; but that it was a cheap way of pleasing to
fix the attention of the reader through a long poem on the mere
<i>appetite</i>. Well! but, said he, you see, that such poems please every
body. I answered, that it was the province of a great poet to raise
people up to his own level, not to descend to theirs. He agreed, and
confessed, that on no account whatsoever would he have written a work
like the OBERON. He spoke in raptures of Wieland's style, and pointed
out the passage where Retzia is delivered of her child, as exquisitely
beautiful.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>{419}</span></p>

<p>I said that I did not perceive any very striking passages; but that I
made allowance for the imperfections of a translation. Of the thefts of
Wieland, he said, they were so exquisitely managed, that the greatest
writers might be proud to steal as he did. He considered the books and
fables of old romance writers in the light of the ancient mythology, as
a sort of common property, from which a man was free to take whatever he
could make a good use of. An Englishman had presented him with the odes
of Collins, which he had read with pleasure. He knew little or nothing
of Gray, except his ELEGY written in a country CHURCH-YARD. He
complained of the fool in LEAR. I observed that he seemed to give a
terrible wildness to the distress; but still he complained. He asked
whether it was not allowed, that Pope had written rhymed poetry with
more skill than any of our writers&mdash;I said I preferred Dryden, because
his couplets had greater variety in their movement. He thought my reason
a good one; but asked whether the rhyme of Pope were not more exact.
This question I understood as applying to the final terminations, and
observed to him that I believed it was the case; but that I thought it
was easy to excuse some inaccuracy in the final sounds, if the general
sweep of the verse was superiour. I told him that we were not so exact
with regard to the final endings of lines as the French. He did not seem
to know that we made no distinction between masculine and feminine (i.e.
single or double,) rhymes: at least he put inquiries to me on this
subject. He seemed to think, that no language could be so far formed as
that it might not be enriched by idioms borrowed from another tongue. I
said this was a very dangerous practice; and added, that I thought
Milton had often injured both his prose and verse by taking this liberty
too frequently. I recommended to him the prose works of Dryden as models
of pure and native English. I was treading upon tender ground, as I have
reason to suppose that he has himself liberally indulged in the
practice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>{420}</span></p>

<p>The same day I dined at Mr. Klopstock's, where I had the pleasure of a
third interview with the poet. We talked principally about indifferent
things. I asked him what he thought of Kant. He said that his reputation
was much on the decline in Germany. That for his own part he was not
surprised to find it so, as the works of Kant were to him utterly
incomprehensible&mdash;that he had often been pestered by the Kanteans; but
was rarely in the practice of arguing with them. His custom was to
produce the book, open it and point to a passage, and beg they would
explain it. This they ordinarily attempted to do by substituting their
own ideas. I do not want, I say, an explanation of your own ideas, but
of the passage which is before us. In this way I generally bring the
dispute to an immediate conclusion. He spoke of Wolfe as the first
Metaphysician they had in Germany. Wolfe had followers; but they could
hardly be called a sect, and luckily till the appearance of Kant, about
fifteen years ago, Germany had not been pestered by any sect of
philosophers whatsoever; but that each man had separately pursued his
inquiries uncontrolled by the dogmas of a master. Kant had appeared
ambitious to be the founder of a sect; that he had succeeded: but that
the Germans were now coming to their senses again. That Nicolai and
Engel had in different ways contributed to disenchant the nation;<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
but above all the incomprehensibility of the philosopher and his
philosophy. He seemed pleased to hear, that as yet Kant's doctrines had
not met with many admirers in England&mdash;did not doubt but that we had too
much wisdom to be duped by a writer who set at defiance the common sense
and common understandings of men. We talked of tragedy. He seemed to
rate highly the power of exciting tears&mdash;I said that nothing was more
easy than to deluge an audience, that it was done every day by the
meanest writers.'</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I must remind you, my friend, first, that these notes are not intended

<h3><a name="COLERIDGE" id="COLERIDGE"></a>(<i>b</i>) PERSONAL REMINISCENCES (1836), BY THE HON. MR. JUSTICE COLERIDGE.</h3>

<p>In the summer of 1836 I went on the Northern Circuit with Baron Parke.
We took Bowness and Storrs, in our way from Appleby to Lancaster; and I
visited Wordsworth, and my dear friend Arnold from Storrs. It was my
fortune to have to try the great Hornby Castle cause, as it was called;
this I did at the end of the circuit, returning from Liverpool to
Lancaster for the purpose. Arnold was kind enough to lend me his house
(Foxhow) for the vacation; and when the circuit ended, my wife and
children accompanied me to it, and we remained there six weeks. During
that time Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth were our only neighbours, and we
scarcely saw any one besides; but we needed no other addition to the
lovely and loveable country in which we were. He was extremely kind,
both in telling us where to go, and very often going with us. He was
engaged in correcting the press for a new edition of his poems. The
London post, I think, went out at 2 P.M., and then, he would say, he was
at our service. A walk with him in that country was a real treat: I
never met with a man who seemed to know a country and the people so
well, or to love them better, nor one who had such exquisite taste for
rural scenery: he had evidently cultivated it with great care; he not
only admired the beauties, but he could tell you what were the peculiar
features in each scene, or what the incidents to which it owed its
peculiar charm. He combined, beyond any man with whom I ever met, the
unsophisticated poetic delight in the beauties of nature with a somewhat
artistic skill in developing the sources and conditions of them. In
examining the parts of a landscape he would be minute; and he dealt with
shrubs, flower-beds, and lawns with the readiness of a practiced
landscape-gardener. His own little grounds afforded a beautiful specimen
of his skill in this latter respect;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>{424}</span> and it was curious to see how he
had imparted the same faculty in some measure to his gardener&mdash;James
Dixon, I think, was his name. I found them together one morning in the
little lawn by the Mount. 'James and I,' said he, 'are in a puzzle here.
The grass here has spots which offend the eye; and I told him we must
cover them with soap-lees. "That," he says, "will make the green there
darker than the rest." "Then," I said, "we must cover the whole." He
objected: "That will not do with reference to the little lawn to which
you pass from this." "Cover that," I said. To which he replies, "You
will have an unpleasant contrast with the foliage surrounding it."'</p>

<p>Beside this warm feeling and exquisite taste, which made him so
delightful a guide, his favourite spots had a human interest engrafted
on them,&mdash;some tradition, some incident, some connection with his own
poetry, or himself, or some dear friend. These he brought out in a
striking way. Apart from these, he was well pleased to discourse on
poetry or poets; and here appeared to me to be his principal
scholarship. He was extremely well read in English poetry; and he would
in his walk review a poem or a poet with admirable precision and
fairness. He did not intrude his own poetry or himself, but he did not
decline to talk about either; and he spoke of both simply, unboastingly,
and yet with a manly consciousness of their worth. It was clear he
thought he had achieved a high place among poets: it had been the aim of
his life, humanly speaking; and he had taken worthy pains to accomplish
and prepare himself for the enterprise. He never would sacrifice
anything he thought right on reflection, merely to secure present
popularity, or avert criticism which he thought unfounded; but he was a
severe critic on himself, and would not leave a line or an expression
with which he was dissatisfied until he had brought it to what he liked.
He thought this due to the gift of poetry and the character of the poet.
Carelessness in the finish of composition he seemed to look on almost as
an offence. I remember well, that after speaking with love and delight
of a very popular volume of poetry, he yet found great fault with the
want of correctness and finish. Reciting one of the poems, and pointing
out inaccuracies in it, he said, 'I like the volume so much, that, if I
was the author, I think I should never rest till I had nearly rewritten
it.' No doubt he carried this in his own case to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>{425}</span>excess, when he
corrected so largely, in the decline of life, poems written in early
manhood, under a state of feelings and powers which it was impossible to
reproduce, and yet which was necessary, generally speaking, for
successful alteration. I cannot but agree with many who think that on
this account the earlier copies of his poems are more valuable than the
later.</p>

<p>1836. <i>September</i>. Wednesday 21.&mdash;Wordsworth and I started in my
carriage for Lowther, crossed Kirkstone to Paterdale, by Ulleswater,
going through the Glenridding Walks,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> and calling at Hallsteads. We
reached the castle time enough before dinner for him to give me a walk.</p>

<p>After luncheon, on Thursday 22d, we had an open carriage, and proceeded
to Haweswater. It is a fine lake, entirely unspoilt by bad taste. On one
side the bank rises high and steep, and is well clothed with wood; on
the other it is bare and more sloping. Wordsworth conveyed a personal
interest in it to me, by telling me that it was the first lake which my
uncle<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> had seen on his coming into this country: he was in company
with Wordsworth and his brother John. Wordsworth pointed out to me
somewhere about the spot on the hill-side, a little out of the track,
from which they first saw the lake; and said, he well remembered how his
face brightened, and how much delight he appeared to feel. Yesterday
morning we returned to this place. We called on our way and took our
luncheon at Hallsteads, and also called at Paterdale Hall. At both it
was gratifying to see the cordial manner of W.'s reception: he seemed
loved and honoured; and his manner was of easy, hearty, kindness to
them.</p>

<p>My tour with him was very agreeable, and I wish I could preserve in my
memory more of his conversation than I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>{426}</span> be able to do. I was
anxious to get from him anecdotes of himself and my uncle, and of their
works. He told me of himself, that his first verses were a Popian copy
written at school on the 'Pleasure of Change;' then he wrote another on
the 'Second Centenary of the School's Foundation;' that he had written
these verses on the holidays, and on the return to school; that he was
rather the poet of the school. The first verses from which he remembered
to have received great pleasure, were Miss Carter's 'Poem on Spring,' a
poem in the six-line stanza, which he was particularly fond of, and had
composed much in, for example, 'Ruth.' He said there was some foundation
in fact, however slight, for every poem he had written of a narrative
kind; so slight indeed, sometimes, as hardly to deserve the name; for
example, 'The Somnambulist' was wholly built on the fact of a girl at
Lyulph's Tower being a sleep-walker; and 'The Water Lily,' on a ship
bearing that name. 'Michael' was founded on the son of an old couple
having become dissolute and run away from his parents; and on an old
shepherd having been seven years in building up a sheepfold in a
solitary valley: 'The Brothers,' on a young shepherd, in his sleep,
having fallen down a crag, his staff remaining suspended midway. Many
incidents he seemed to have drawn from the narration of Mrs. Wordsworth,
or his sister, 'Ellen' for example, in 'The Excursion;' and they must
have told their stories well, for he said his principle had been to give
the oral part as nearly as he could in the very words of the speakers,
where he narrated a real story, dropping, of course, all vulgarisms or
provincialisms, and borrowing sometimes a Bible turn of expression:
these former were mere accidents, not essential to the truth in
representing how the human heart and passions worked; and to give these
last faithfully was his object. If he was to have any name hereafter,
his hope was on this, and he did think he had in some instances
succeeded;<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> that the sale of his poems increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>{427}</span> among the classes
below the middle; and he had had, constantly, statements made to him of
the effect produced in reading 'Michael' and other such of his poems. I
added my testimony of being unable to read it aloud without interruption
from my own feelings. 'She was a phantom of delight' he said was written
on 'his dear wife,' of whom he spoke in the sweetest manner; a manner
full of the warmest love and admiration, yet with delicacy and reserve.
He very much and repeatedly regretted that my uncle had written so
little verse; he thought him so eminently qualified, by his very nice
ear, his great skill in metre, and his wonderful power and happiness of
expression. He attributed, in part, his writing so little, to the
extreme care and labour which he applied in elaborating his metres. He
said, that when he was intent on a new experiment in metre, the time and
labour he bestowed were inconceivable; that he was quite an epicure in
sound. Latterly he thought he had so much acquired the habit of
analysing his feelings, and making them matter for a theory or argument,
that he had rather dimmed his delight in the beauties of nature and
injured his poetical powers. He said he had no idea how 'Christabelle'
was to have been finished, and he did not think my uncle had ever
conceived, in his own mind, any definite plan for it; that the poem had
been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse, and almost
in his presence, and when there was the most unreserved intercourse
between them as to all their literary projects and productions, and he
had never heard from him any plan for finishing it. Not that he doubted
my uncle's <i>sincerity</i> in his subsequent assertions to the contrary;
because, he said, schemes of this sort passed rapidly and vividly
through his mind, and so impressed him, that he often fancied he had
arranged things, which really and upon trial proved to be mere embryos.
I omitted to ask him, what seems obvious enough now, whether, in
conversing about it, he had never asked my uncle how it would end. The
answer would have settled the question. He regretted that the story had
not been made to end the same night in which it begun. There was
difficulty and danger in bringing such a personage as the witch to the
daylight, and the breakfast-table; and unless the poem was to have been
long enough to give time for creating a second interest, there was a
great probability of the conclusion being flat after such a
commencement.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>{428}</span>
<p>A great number of my uncle's sonnets, he said, were written from the
'Cat and Salutation,' or a public-house with some such name, in
Smithfield, where my uncle imprisoned himself for some time; and they
appeared in a newspaper, I think he said the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>He remembered his writing a great part of the translation of
'Wallenstein,' and he said there was nothing more astonishing than the
ease and rapidity with which it was done.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 29th, Foxhow</i>.&mdash;We are just setting out, in a promising day, for
a second trip to Keswick, intending, if possible, to penetrate into
Wastdale, over the Sty Head. Before I go, I wish to commemorate a walk
with the Poet, on a drizzly muddy day, the turf sponging out water at
every step, through which he stalked as regardless as if he were of
iron, and with the same fearless, unchanged pace over rough and smooth,
slippery and sound. We went up by the old road<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> from Ambleside to
Keswick, and struck off from the table-land on the left, over the fell
ground, till he brought me out on a crag, bounded, as it were, by two
ascents, and showing me in front, as in a frame, Grasmere Lake, 'the one
green island,' the church, village, &amp;c., and the surrounding mountains.
It is a lovely scene, strikingly described in his verses beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'When to the attractions of the busy world,<br /></span>
<span>Preferring studious leisure,' &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Oct. 7th</i>.&mdash;Yesterday Wordsworth drove me to Low-wovel; and then we
ascended a great way towards Kirkstone by Troutbeck, passing by many
interesting cots, barns, and farm-houses, where W. had constantly
something to point out in the architecture, or the fringes of moss,
fern, &amp;c., on the roofs or walls. We crossed the valley, and descended
on Troutbeck Church, whence we came down to the turnpike road, and I
left the Poet, who was going on to assist Sir T. Pasley in laying out
his grounds. I turned homeward, till I met my horse.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>{429}</span>As we walked, I was admiring the never-ceasing sound of water, so
remarkable in this country. 'I was walking,' he said, 'on the mountains,
with &mdash;&mdash;, the Eastern traveller; it was after rain, and the torrents
were full. I said, "I hope you like your companions&mdash;these bounding,
joyous, foaming streams." "No," said the traveller, pompously, "I think
they are not to be compared in delightful effect with the silent
solitude of the Arabian Desert." My mountain blood was up. I quickly
observed that he had boots and a stout great-coat on, and said, "I am
sorry you don't like this; perhaps I can show you what will please you
more." I strode away, and led him from crag to crag, hill to vale, and
vale to hill, for about six hours; till I thought I should have had to
bring him home, he was so tired.'</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>October 10th</i>.&mdash;I have passed a great many hours to-day with
Wordsworth, in his house. I stumbled on him with proof sheets before
him. He read me nearly all the sweet stanzas written in his copy of the
'Castle of Indolence,'<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> describing himself and my uncle; and he and
Mrs. W. both assured me the description of the latter at that time was
perfectly accurate; that he was almost as a great boy in feelings, and
had all the tricks and fancies there described. Mrs. W. seemed to look
back on him, and those times, with the fondest affection. Then he read
me some lines, which formed part of a suppressed portion of 'The
Waggoner;' but which he is now printing 'on the Rock of Names,' so
called because on it they had carved out their initials:</p>

<p>
W.W.    Wm. Wordsworth.<br />
M.H.    Mary W.<br />
D.W.    Dorothy Wordsworth.<br />
S.T.C.    Samuel Taylor Coleridge.<br />
J.W.    John Wordsworth.<br />
S.H.    Sarah Hutchinson.<br />
</p>

<p>This rock was about a mile beyond Wythburn Chapel, to which they used to
accompany my uncle, in going to Keswick from Grasmere, and where they
would meet him when he returned. This led him to read much of 'The
Waggoner' to me. It seems a very favourite poem of his, and he read me
splendid descriptions from it. He said his object in it had not been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>{430}</span>understood. It was a play of the fancy on a domestic incident and lowly
character: he wished by the opening descriptive lines to put his reader
into the state of mind in which he wished it to be read. If he failed in
doing that, he wished him to lay it down. He pointed out, with the same
view, the glowing lines on the state of exultation in which Ben and his
companions are under the influence of liquor. Then he read the sickening
languor of the morning walk, contrasted with the glorious uprising of
Nature, and the songs of the birds. Here he has added about six most
exquisite lines.</p>

<p>We walked out on the turf terrace, on the Loughrigg side of Rydal Water.
Most exquisitely did the lake and opposite bank look. Thence he led me
home under Loughrigg, through lovely spots I had never seen before. His
conversation was on critical subjects, arising out of his attempts to
alter his poems. He said he considered 'The White Doe' as, in
conception, the highest work he had ever produced. The mere physical
action was all unsuccessful; but the true action of the poem was
spiritual&mdash;the subduing of the will, and all inferior passions, to the
perfect purifying and spiritualising of the intellectual nature; while
the Doe, by connection with Emily, is raised as it were from its mere
animal nature into something mysterious and saint-like. He said he
should devote much labour to perfecting the execution of it in the mere
business parts, in which, from anxiety 'to get on' with the more
important parts, he was sensible that imperfections had crept in, which
gave the style a feebleness of character.</p>

<p>He talked of Milton, and observed how he sometimes indulged himself, in
the 'Paradise Lost,' in lines which, if not in time, you could hardly
call verse, instancing,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'And Tiresias and Phineus, prophets old;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and then noticed the sweet-flowing lines which followed, and with regard
to which he had no doubt the unmusical line before had been inserted.</p>

<p>'Paradise Regained' he thought the most perfect in <i>execution</i> of
anything written by Milton; that and the 'Merchant of Venice,' in
language, he thought were almost faultless: with the exception of some
little straining in some of the speeches about the caskets, he said,
they were perfect, the genuine <span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>{431}</span>English expressions of the ideas of
their own great minds. Thomson he spoke of as a real poet, though it
appeared less in his 'Seasons' than in his other poems. He had wanted
some judicious adviser to correct his taste; but every person he had to
deal with only served to injure it. He had, however, a true love and
feeling for Nature, and a greater share of poetical imagination, as
distinguished from dramatic, than any man between Milton and him. As he
stood looking at Ambleside, seen across the valley, embosomed in wood,
and separated from us at sufficient distance, he quoted from Thomson's
'Hymn on Solitude,' and suggested the addition, or rather insertion, of
a line at the close, where he speaks of glancing at London from Norwood.
The line, he said, should have given something of a more favourable
impression:</p>

<p>'Ambition&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> and pleasure vain.'</p>

<p><i>October 14th, Foxhow</i>.&mdash;We have had a delightful day to-day. The
weather being fine, Wordsworth agreed to go with us into Easedale; so we
got three ponies, for Mary and Madge, and Fred and Alley, alternately,
and walked from Grasmere, he <i>trudging</i><a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> before, with his green
gauze shade over his eyes, and in his plaid jacket and waistcoat. First,
he turned aside at a little farm-house, and took us into a swelling
field, to look down on the tumbling stream which bounded it, and which
we saw precipitated at a distance, in a broad white sheet, from the
mountain. A beautiful water-break of the same stream was before us at
our feet, and he noticed the connection which it formed in the landscape
with the distant waterfall. Then, as he mused for an instant, he said,
'I have often thought what a solemn thing it would be, if we could have
brought to our mind, at once, all the scenes of distress and misery,
which any spot, however beautiful and calm before us, has been witness
to since the beginning. That water-break, with the glassy, quiet pool
beneath it, that looks so lovely, and presents no images to the mind but
of peace,&mdash;there, I remember, the only son of his father, a poor man,
who lived yonder, was drowned. He missed him, came to search, and saw
his body dead in the pool.' We pursued our way up the stream, not a very
easy way for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>{432}</span> horses, near to the waterfall before mentioned, and so
gradually up to the Tarn. Oh, what a scene! The day one of the softest
and brightest in autumn; the lights various; the mountains in the
richest colouring, fern covering them with reddish gold in great part;
here and there, trees in every variety of autumn foliage; and the rock
itself of a kind of lilac tint; the outlines of the mountains very fine;
the Tarn, which might almost be called a lake for size and abundance of
water, with no culture, or trees, or habitation around it, here and
there a great rock stretching into it like a promontory, and high
mountains surrounding it on three sides, on two of them almost
precipitate; on the fourth side, it is more open, and on this the
stream, crossed by four great stepping-stones, runs out of it, and
descends into Grasmere vale and lake. He pointed out the precipitous
mountain at the head of the Tarn, and told us an incident of his sister
and himself coming from Langdale, which lies on the other side. He
having for some reason parted, she encountered a fog, and was
bewildered. At last, she sat down and waited; in a short time it began
to clear; she could see that a valley was before her. In time, she saw
the backs of cattle feeding, which emerged from the darkness, and at
last the Tarn; and then found she had stopped providentially, and was
sitting nearly on the edge of the precipice. Our return was somewhat
more perilous for the riders than the ascent; but we accomplished it
safely, and, in our return, turned in Butterlip How, a circular, soft,
green hill, surrounded with oak trees, at the head of Grasmere. It is
about twenty acres, and belongs to a London banker, purchased, as I
suppose, with a view to building on it. It is a lovely spot for a house,
with delicious views of the lake and church, Easedale, Helm Crag, &amp;c. I
have seen no place, I think, on which I should so much like to build my
retreat.</p>

<p><i>October 16th</i>.&mdash;Since church, we have taken our last walk with
Wordsworth. M. was mounted on Dora W.'s pony. He led us up on Loughrigg,
round to the Tarn, by the back of Loughrigg to the foot of Grasmere
Lake, and so home by this side of Rydal; the weather warm and fine, and
a lovely walk it was. The views of the mountains, Langdale Way, the Tarn
itself and its banks, and the views on Grasmere and Rydal Waters, are
almost beyond anything I have seen, even in this country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>{433}</span></p>

<p>He and Mrs. W. came this evening to bid us farewell. We parted with
great, I believe mutual, regret; certainly they have been kind to us in
a way and degree which seemed unequivocally to testify good liking to
us, and them it is impossible not to love. The more I have seen of
Wordsworth, the more I admire him as a poet and as a man. He has the
finest and most discriminating feeling for the beauties of Nature that I
ever witnessed; he expresses himself in glowing and yet manly language
about them. There is much simplicity in his character, much <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>,
but it is all generous and highly moral.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<h3><a name="ROBINSON" id="ROBINSON"></a>(<i>c</i>) RECOLLECTIONS OF TOUR IN ITALY, BY H.C. ROBINSON.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Oct. 18. 1850.</span><br />
<br />
MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>I feel quite ashamed, I assure you, of sending you the Itinerary of my
journey with Mr. Wordsworth, so poorly accompanied as it must be, and
the more, because Mr. Wordsworth seems to have thought that I might be
able to make a contribution to your work worth your acceptance. At the
same time, I am much relieved by recollecting that he himself cared
nothing for the connection which a place might have with a great poet,
unless an acquaintance with it served to illustrate his works. He made
this remark in the Church of St. Onofrio at Rome, where Tasso lies
buried. The place which, on this account, interested him more than any
other on the journey was <i>Vaucluse</i>, while he cared nothing for Arezzo,
which claims to be the place of Petrarch's birth. Indeed, a priest on
the spot, on another visit, said it is not certain that he was born
there, much less in the house marked with his name. Mr. W. was not
without the <i>esprit de corps</i>, even before his official dignity, and
took great interest in Savona, on account of Chiabrera, as appears in
the 'Musings near Aquapendente,' perhaps the most beautiful of these
Memorials of the Italian tour&mdash;'alas too few!' As he himself repeatedly
said of the journey, 'It is too late.' 'I have matter for volumes,' he
said once, 'had I but youth to work it up.' It is remarkable how in this
admirable poem meditation predominates over observation. It often
happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>{434}</span> that objects of universal attraction served chiefly to bring
back to his mind absent objects dear to him. When we were on that noble
spot, the Amphitheatre at Nismes, I observed his eyes fixed in a
direction where there was the least to be seen; and, looking that way, I
beheld two very young children at play with flowers; and I overheard him
say to himself, 'Oh! you darlings, I wish I could put you in my pocket
and carry you to Rydal Mount.'</p>

<p>It was Mr. Theed, the sculptor, who informed us of the pine tree being
the gift of Sir George Beaumont. This incident occurred within a few
minutes after our walking up the Pincian Hill. And this was the very
first observation Mr. W. made at Rome.</p>

<p>It was a remark justly made on the Memorials of the Swiss Journey in
1820, that Mr. W. left unnoticed the great objects which have given rise
to innumerable common-place verses and huge piles of bad prose, and
which every body talks about, while he dwelt on impressions peculiar to
himself. As a reproach, nothing can be more idle and unmeaning. I
expected it would be so with these latter poems, and so I found it.
There are not more than two others which bring anything to my mind.</p>

<p>The most important of these is the 'Cuckoo at Laverna.' I recollect
perfectly well that I heard the cuckoo at Laverna twice before he heard
it; and that it absolutely fretted him that my ear was first favoured;
and that he exclaimed with delight, 'I hear it! I hear it!' It was at
Laverna, too, that he led me to expect that he had found a subject on
which he would write; and that was the love which birds bore to St.
Francis. He repeated to me a short time afterwards a few lines, which I
do not recollect among those he has written on St. Francis in this poem.
On the journey, one night only I heard him in bed composing verses, and
on the following day I offered to be his amanuensis; but I was not
patient enough, I fear, and he did not employ me a second time. He made
inquiries for St. Francis's biography, as if he would dub him his
Leib-heiliger (body-saint), as Goethe (saying that every one must have
one) declared St. Philip Neri to be his.</p>

<p>The painter monk at Camaldoli also interested him, but he heard my
account only in addition to a <i>very poor</i> exhibition of professional
talent; but he would not allow the pictures to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id="page435"></a>{435}</span> so very poor, as
every nun ought to be beautiful when she takes the veil.</p>

<p>I recollect, too, the pleasure he expressed when I said to him, 'You are
now sitting in Dante's chair.' It faces the south transept of the
cathedral at Florence.</p>

<p>I have been often asked whether Mr. W. wrote anything on the journey,
and my answer has always been, 'Little or nothing.' Seeds were cast into
the earth, and they took root slowly. This reminds me that I once was
privy to the conception of a sonnet, with a distinctness which did not
once occur on the longer Italian journey. This was when I accompanied
him into the Isle of Man. We had been drinking tea with Mr. and Mrs.
Cookson, and left them when the weather was dull. Very soon after
leaving them we passed the church tower of Bala Sala. The upper part of
the tower had a sort of frieze of yellow lichens. Mr. W. pointed it out
to me, and said, 'It's a perpetual sunshine.' I thought no more of it,
till I read the beautiful sonnet,</p>

</div></div>

<p>and then I exclaimed, I was present at the conception of this sonnet, at
least of the combination of thought out of which it arose.</p>

<p>I beg to subscribe myself, with sincere esteem,</p>

<h3>(<i>d</i>) REMINISCENCES OF WORDSWORTH.</h3>
<a name="RICHARDSON" id="RICHARDSON"></a>
<div class="center">BY LADY RICHARDSON, AND MRS. DAVY, OF THE OAKS, AMBLESIDE.</div>

<div class="center">(1.) LADY RICHARDSON.</div>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">Lancrigg, Easedale, August 26. 1841.</span>
</p>

<p>Wordsworth made some striking remarks on Goethe in a walk on the terrace
yesterday. He thinks that the German poet is greatly overrated, both in
this country and his own. He said, 'He does not seem to me to be a great
poet in either of the classes of poets. At the head of the first class I
would place Homer and Shakspeare, whose universal minds are able to
reach every variety of thought and feeling without bringing their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>{436}</span>individuality before the reader. They infuse, they breathe life into
every object they approach, but you never find <i>themselves</i>. At the head
of the second class, those whom you can trace individually in all they
write, I would place Spenser and Milton. In all that Spenser writes you
can trace the gentle affectionate spirit of the man; in all that Milton
writes you find the exalted sustained being that he was. Now in what
Goethe writes, who aims to be of the first class, the <i>universal</i>, you
find the man himself, the artificial man, where he should not be found;
so consider him a very artificial writer, aiming to be universal, and
yet constantly exposing his individuality, which his character was not
of a kind to dignify. He had not sufficiently clear moral perceptions to
make him anything but an artificial writer.</p>

<p>Tuesday, the 2d of May, Wordsworth and Miss F. came early to walk about
and dine. He was in a very happy kindly mood. We took a walk on the
terrace, and he went as usual to his favourite points. On our return he
was struck with the berries on the holly tree, and said, 'Why should not
you and I go and pull some berries from the other side of the tree,
which is not seen from the window? and then we can go and plant them in
the rocky ground behind the house.' We pulled the berries, and set forth
with our tool. I made the holes, and the Poet put in the berries. He was
as earnest and eager about it, as if it had been a matter of importance;
and as he put the seeds in, he every now and then muttered, in his low
solemn tone, that beautiful verse from Burns's 'Vision:'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'And wear thou this, she solemn said,<br /></span>
<span>And bound the holly round my head.<br /></span>
<span>The polished leaves and berries red<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Did rustling play;<br /></span>
<span>And like a passing thought she fled<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In light away.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He clambered to the highest rocks in the 'Tom Intake,' and put in the
berries in such situations as Nature sometimes does with such true and
beautiful effect. He said, 'I like to do this for posterity. Some people
are selfish enough to say, What has posterity done for me? but the past
does much for us.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id="page437"></a>{437}</span></p>


<div class="center">(II.) ADDITIONAL SENT TO THE PRESENT EDITOR BY LADY RICHARDSON.</div>

<p><i>August 28th</i>, 1841.&mdash;Mr. Wordsworth, Miss Fenwick, and Mrs. Hill came
to dine, and it rained on the whole day, but happily the Poet talked on
from two to eight without being weary, as we certainly were not. After
dinner, when we came to the drawing-room, the conversation turned on the
treatment of Wordsworth by the reviews of the day. I had never heard him
open out on it before, and was much struck with the manner in which he
did it; from his present elevation looking calmly back on the past, and
at the same time feeling that an irreparable injury had been done to him
at the time when life and hope were young. As nearly as I can I shall
record his words as they were spoken. He said:</p>

<p>'At the time I resolved to dedicate myself to poetry and separate myself
from the ordinary lucrative professions, it would certainly have been a
great object to me to have reaped the profits I should have done from my
writings but for the stupidity of Mr. Gifford and the impertinence of
Mr. Jeffrey. It would have enabled me to purchase many books which I
could not obtain, and I should have gone to Italy earlier, which I never
could afford to do until I was sixty-five, when Moxon gave me a thousand
pounds for my writings. This was the only kind of injury Mr. Jeffrey did
me, for I immediately perceived that his mind was of that kind that his
individual opinion on poetry was of no consequence to me whatever, that
it was only by the influence his periodical exercised at the time in
preventing my poems being read and sold that he could injure me; for
feeling that my writings were founded on what was true and spiritual in
human nature, I knew the time would come when they must be known, and I
never therefore felt his opinion of the slightest value, except in
preventing the young of that generation from receiving impressions which
might have been of use to them through life. I say this, I hope not in a
boasting spirit, but I am now daily surprised by receiving letters from
various places at home and abroad expressive of gratitude to me from
persons I never saw or heard of. As this occurs now, I may fairly
conclude that it might have been so when the poems appeared, but for the
tyranny exercised over public opinion by the <i>Edinburgh</i> and <i>Quarterly
Reviews</i>.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>{438}</span></p>

<p><i>December</i> 1841.&mdash;Wordsworth and Miss Fenwick spent the shortest day of
the year with us; he brought with him his Epitaph on Southey, and as we
sat round the fire after dinner, my mother asked him to read it to us,
which he did in his usual impressive manner. He asked our impression of
it. My mother ventured to tell him of one word, or rather two, which she
thought might be altered with advantage. They were these:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Wide was his range, but ne'er in human breast<br /></span>
<span>Did private feeling find a holier nest.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Holier nest' were the words she objected to, as not being a correct
union of ideas. He took the suggestion most kindly, and said it had been
much discussed in his own mind and in his family circle, but that he saw
the force of what she said, and that he was aware many others would see
it also. He said there was yet time to change it, and that he should
consult Judge Coleridge whether the line, as he once had it,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Did private feeling meet in holier rest,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>would not be more appropriate to the simplicity of an epitaph where you
con every word, and where every word is expected to bear an exact
meaning. We all thought this was an improvement. During tea he talked
with great animation of the separation of feeling between the rich and
poor in this country; the reason of this he thinks is the greater
freedom we enjoy; that the line of demarcation not being so clearly laid
down in this country by the law as in others, people fancy they must
make it for themselves. He considers Christianity the only cure for this
state of things. He spoke of his own desire to carry out the feeling of
brotherhood with regard to servants, which he all along endeavoured to
do. He doubted whether he might not have had better servants on a
different system; but he thought it right to endeavour to inspire your
domestics with a feeling of common interest. My mother said she entirely
agreed with him, but she had always found it most difficult.</p>


<div class="center">(III.) LADY RICHARDSON (CONTINUED).</div>

<p><i>November</i> 1843.&mdash;Wordsworth holds the critical power very low,
infinitely lower than the inventive; and he said to-day that if the
quantity of time considered in writing critiques on the works of others
were given to original composition, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id="page439"></a>{439}</span> whatever kind it might be, it
would be much better employed; it would make a man find out sooner his
own level, and it would do infinitely less mischief. A false or
malicious criticism may do much injury to the minds of others; a stupid
invention, either in prose or verse, is quite harmless.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 22<i>d</i>, 1843.&mdash;The shortest day is past, and it was a very
pleasant one to us, for Wordsworth and Miss Fenwick offered to spend it
with us. They came early, and, although it was misty and dingy, he
proposed to walk up Easedale. We went by the terrace, and through the
little gate on the Fell, round by Brimmer Head, having diverged a little
up from Easedale, nearly as far as the ruined cottage. He said, when he
and his sister wandered there so much, that cottage was inhabited by a
man of the name of Benson, a waller, its last inhabitant. He said on the
terrace, 'This is a striking anniversary to me; for this day forty-four
years ago, my sister and I took up our abode at Grasmere, and three days
after we found out this walk, which long remained our favourite haunt.'
There is always something very touching in his way of speaking of his
sister; the tones of his voice become more gentle and solemn, and he
ceases to have that flow of expression which is so remarkable in him on
all other subjects. It is as if the sadness connected with her present
condition was too much for him to dwell upon in connection with the
past, although habit and the 'omnipotence of circumstance' have made its
daily presence less oppressive to his spirits. He said that his sister
spoke constantly of their early days, but more of the years they spent
together in other parts of England than those at Grasmere. As we
proceeded on our walk he happened to speak of the frequent unhappiness
of married persons, and the low and wretched principles on which the
greater number of marriages were formed. He said that unless there was a
strong foundation of love and respect, the 'unavoidable breaks and
cataracts' of domestic life must soon end in mutual aversion, for that
married life ought not to be in theory, and assuredly it never was in
practice, a system of mere submission on either side, but it should be a
system of mutual cooperation for the good of each. If the wife is always
expected to conceal her difference of opinion from her husband, she
ceases to be an equal, and the man loses the advantage which the
marriage tie is intended to provide for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="page440" id="page440"></a>{440}</span> in a civilised and
Christian country. He then went on to say, that, although he never saw
an amiable single woman without wishing that she were married, from his
strong feeling of the happiness of a well-assorted marriage, yet he was
far from thinking that marriage always improved people. It certainly did
not, unless it was a congenial marriage.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>


<div class="center">(IV.) Mrs. DAVY.</div>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 25em;">'The Oaks, Ambleside, Monday, Jan. 22. 1844.</span>
</p>

<p>While Mrs. Quillinan was sitting with us to-day, Henry Fletcher ran in
to say that he had reserved his summons for Oxford (he had been in
suspense about rooms as an exhibitioner at Balliol), and must be off
within an hour. His young cousins and I went down with him to wait for
the mail in the marketplace. We found Mr. Wordsworth walking about
before the post-office door in very charming mood. His spirits were
excited by the bright morning sunshine, and he entered at once on a full
flow of discourse. He looked very benevolently on Henry as he mounted on
the top of the coach, and seemed quite disposed to give an old man's
blessing to the young man entering on an untried field, and then (nowise
interrupted by the hurrying to and fro of ostlers with their smoking
horses, or passengers with their carpet bags) he launched into a
dissertation, in which there was, I thought, a remarkable union of his
powerful diction, and his practical, thoughtful good sense, on the
subject of college habits, and of his utter distrust of all attempts to
nurse virtue by an avoidance of temptation. He expressed also his entire
want of confidence (from experience he said) of highly-wrought religious
expression in youth. The safest training for the mind in religion he
considered to be a contemplating of the character and personal history
of Christ. 'Work it,' he said, 'into your thoughts, into your
imagination, make it a real presence in the mind.' I was rejoiced to
hear this plain, loving confession of a Christian faith from Wordsworth.
I never heard one more earnest, more as if it came out of a devoutly
believing heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page441" id="page441"></a>{441}</span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">The Oaks, March 5. 1844.</span><br />
</p>

<p>On our way to Lancrigg to-day, we called at Foxhow. We met Mr.
Wordsworth there, and asked him to go with us. It was a beautiful day,
one of his very own 'mild days' of this month. He kindly consented, and
walked with us to meet the carriage at Pelter Bridge. On our drive, he
mentioned, with marked pleasure, a dedication written by Mr. Keble, and
sent to him for his approval, and for his permission to have it prefixed
to Mr. Keble's new volumes of Latin Lectures on Poetry delivered at
Oxford. Mr. Wordsworth said that he had never seen any estimate of his
poetical powers, or more especially of his aims in poetry, that appeared
to him so discriminating and so satisfactory. He considers praise a
perilous and a difficult thing. On this subject he often quotes his
lamented friend, Sir George Beaumont, whom, in his intercourse with men
of genius, literary aspirants, he describes as admirable in the modesty
which he inculcated and practised on this head.</p>

<p>The Oaks, Ambleside, July 11. 1844.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth at dinner, along with our family party. Mr. and
Mrs. Price (from Rugby), two aunts of Mrs. P.'s, and her brother, Mr.
Rose, a young clergyman (a devout admirer of Wordsworth), joined us at
tea. A circle was made as large as our little parlour could hold. Mr.
Price sat next to Mr. Wordsworth, and by design or fortunate accident,
introduced some remark on the powers and the discourse of Coleridge. Mr.
Wordsworth entered heartily and largely on the subject. He said that the
liveliest and truest image he could give of Coleridge's talk was 'that
of a majestic river, the sound or sight of whose course you caught at
intervals, which was sometimes concealed by forests, sometimes lost in
sand, then came flashing out broad and distinct, then again took a turn
which your eye could not follow, yet you knew and felt that it was the
same river: so,' he said, 'there was always a train, a stream, in
Coleridge's discourse, always a connection between its parts in his own
mind, though one not always perceptible to the minds of others.' Mr.
Wordsworth went on to say, that in his opinion Coleridge had been spoilt
as a poet by going to Germany. The bent of his mind, which was at all
times very much to metaphysical theology, had there been fixed in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page442" id="page442"></a>{442}</span>direction. 'If it had not been so,' said Wordsworth, 'he would have
been the greatest, the most abiding poet of his age. His very faults
would have made him popular (meaning his sententiousness and laboured
strain), while he had enough of the essentials of a poet to make him
deservedly popular in a higher sense.'</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mr. Price soon after mentioned a statement of Coleridge's respecting
himself, recorded in his 'Table Talk,' namely, that a visit to the
battle-field of Marathon would raise in him no kindling emotion, and
asked Mr. Wordsworth whether this was true as a token of his mind. At
first Mr. Wordsworth said, 'Oh! that was a mere bravado, for the sake of
astonishing his hearers!' but then, correcting himself, he added, 'And
yet it might in some sense be true, for Coleridge was not under the
influence of external objects. He had extraordinary powers of summoning
up an image or series of images in his own mind, and he might mean that
his idea of Marathon was so vivid, that no visible observation could
make it more so.' 'A remarkable instance of this,' added Mr. Wordsworth,
'is his poem, said to be "composed in the Vale of Chamouni." Now he
never was at Chamouni, or near it, in his life.' Mr. Wordsworth next
gave a somewhat humorous account of the rise and progress of the
'Ancient Mariner.' 'It arose,' he said, 'out of the want of five pounds
which Coleridge and I needed to make a tour together in Devonshire. We
agreed to write jointly a poem, the subject of which Coleridge took from
a dream which a friend of his had once dreamt concerning a person
suffering under a dire curse from the commission of some crime.' 'I,'
said Wordsworth, 'supplied the crime, the shooting of the albatross,
from an incident I had met with in one of Shelvocke's voyages. We tried
the poem conjointly for a day or two, but we pulled different ways, and
only a few lines of it are mine.' From Coleridge, the discourse then
turned to Scotland. Mr. Wordsworth, in his best manner, with earnest
thoughts given out in noble diction, gave his reasons for thinking that
as a poet Scott would not live. 'I don't like,' he said, 'to say all
this, or to take to pieces some of the best reputed passages of Scott's
verse, especially in presence of my wife, because she thinks me too
fastidious; but as a poet Scott <i>cannot</i> live, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>{443}</span> he has never in
verse written anything addressed to the immortal part of man. In making
amusing stories in verse, he will be superseded by some newer versifier;
what he writes in the way of natural description is merely rhyming
nonsense.' As a prose writer, Mr. Wordsworth admitted that Scott had
touched a higher vein, because there he had really dealt with feeling
and passion. As historical novels, professing to give the manners of a
past time, he did not attach much value to those works of Scott's so
called, because that he held to be an attempt in which success was
impossible. This led to some remarks on historical writing, from which
it appeared that Mr. Wordsworth has small value for anything but
contemporary history. He laments that Dr. Arnold should have spent so
much of his time and powers in gathering up and putting into imaginary
shape the scattered fragments of the history of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>These scraps of Wordsworth's large, thoughtful, earnest discourse, seem
very meagre as I note them down, and in themselves perhaps hardly worth
preserving and yet this is an evening which those who spent it in his
company will long remember. His venerable head; his simple, natural, and
graceful attitude in his arm-chair; his respectful attention to the
slightest remarks or suggestions of others in relation to what was
spoken of; his kindly benevolence of expression as he looked round now
and then on the circle in our little parlour, all bent to 'devour up his
discourse,' filled up and enlarged the meaning which I fear is but ill
conveyed in the words as they are now set down.</p>


<p>(V.) LADY RICHARDSON: WORDSWORTH'S BIRTH-DAY.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, April the 7th, 1844, my mother<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> and I left Lancrigg to
begin our Yorkshire journey. We arrived at Rydal Mount about three
o'clock, and found the tables all tastefully decorated on the esplanade
in front of the house. The Poet was standing looking at them with a very
pleased expression of face; he received us very kindly, and very soon
the children began to arrive. The Grasmere boys and girls came first,
and took their places on the benches placed round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page444" id="page444"></a>{444}</span> gravelled part of
the esplanade; their eyes fixed with wonder and admiration on the tables
covered with oranges, gingerbread, and painted eggs, ornamented with
daffodils, laurels, and moss, gracefully intermixed. The plot soon began
to thicken, and the scene soon became very animated. Neighbours, old and
young, of all degrees, ascended to the Mount to keep the Poet's
seventy-fourth birthday, and every face looked friendly and happy. Each
child brought its own mug, and held it out to be filled with tea, in
which ceremony all assisted. Large baskets of currant cakes were handed
round and liberally dispensed; and as each detachment of children had
satisfied themselves with tea and cake, they were moved off, to play at
hide and seek among the evergreens on the grassy part of the Mount. The
day was not bright, but it was soft, and not cold, and the scene, viewed
from the upper windows of the house, was quite beautiful, and one I
should have been very sorry not to have witnessed. It was innocent and
gay, and perfectly natural. Miss F&mdash;&mdash;, the donor of the f&ecirc;te, looked
very happy, and so did all the Poet's household. The children, who
amounted altogether to above 300, gave three cheers to Mr. Wordsworth
and Miss F&mdash;&mdash;. After some singing and dancing, and after the division
of eggs, gingerbread, and oranges had taken place, we all began to
disperse. We spent the night at the Oaks, and set off on our journey the
following morning. The gay scene at the Mount often comes before me, as
a pleasant dream. It is perhaps the only part of the island where such a
reunion of all classes could have taken place without any connection of
landlord and tenant, or any clerical relation, or school direction.
Wordsworth, while looking at the gambols on the Mount, expressed his
conviction that if such meetings could oftener take place between people
of different condition, a much more friendly feeling would be created
than now exists in this country between the rich and poor.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>July 12th,</i> 1844.&mdash;Wordsworth spoke much during the evening of his
early intercourse with Coleridge, on some one observing that it was
difficult to carry away a distinct impression from Coleridge's
conversation, delightful as every one felt his outpourings to be.
Wordsworth agreed, but said he was occasionally very happy in clothing
an idea in words; and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id="page445"></a>{445}</span> mentioned one which was recorded in his
sister's journal during a tour they all made together in Scotland. They
passed a steam engine, and Wordsworth made some observation to the
effect that it was scarcely possible to divest oneself of the impression
on seeing it that it had life and volition. 'Yes,' replied Coleridge,
'it is a giant with one idea.'</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He discoursed at great length on Scott's works. His poetry he considered
of that kind which will always he in demand, and that the supply will
always meet it, suited to the age. He does not consider that it in any
way goes below the surface of things; it does not reach to any
intellectual or spiritual emotion; it is altogether superficial, and he
felt it himself to be so. His descriptions are not true to Nature; they
are addressed to the ear, not to the mind. He was a master of bodily
movements in his battle-scenes; but very little productive power was
exerted in popular creations.</p>


<p>DUDDON EXCURSION</p>

<p>On Friday, the 6th September 1844, I set off to breakfast at Rydal
Mount, it being the day fixed by Mr. Wordsworth for our long-projected
excursion to the Valley of the Duddon.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The rain fell in torrents, and it became doubtful whether we should set
off or not; but as it was a thunder-shower, we waited till it was over,
and then Wordsworth, Mr. Quillinan, Miss Hutchinson, and I, set forth in
our carriage to Coniston, where we were to find the Rydal Mount carriage
awaiting us with Mr. Hutchinson. Wordsworth talked very agreeably on the
way to Coniston, and repeated several verses of his own, which he seemed
pleased that Serjeant Talfourd had repeated to him the day before. He
mentioned a singular instance of T. Campbell's inaccuracy of memory in
having actually printed as his own a poem of Wordsworth's, 'The
Complaint:' he repeated it beautifully as we were going up the hill to
Coniston. On reaching the inn in the village of Coniston, the rain again
fell in torrents. At length, the carriages were ordered to the door with
the intention of our returning home; but just as they were ready the sun
broke out, and we turned the horse's head towards Ulpha Kirk. The right
bank of Coniston was all new to me after we passed the village, and Old
Man of Coniston. The scenery ceases to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page446" id="page446"></a>{446}</span> be bold and rugged, but is very
pleasing, the road passing through hazel copses, the openings showing
nice little cornfields and comfortable detached farms, with old
uncropped trees standing near them; some very fine specimens of old ash
trees, which I longed to transport to Easedale, where they have been so
cruelly lopped. The opening towards the sea, as we went on, was very
pleasing; but the first striking view of the Duddon was looking down
upon it soon after we passed Broughton, where you turn to the right, and
very soon after perceive the peculiar beauty of the valley, although it
does not take its wild and dreamlike beauty till you pass Ulpha Kirk. We
reversed the order of the sonnets, and saw the river first, 'in radiant
progress tow'rd the deep,' instead of tracing this 'child of the clouds'
from its cradle in the lofty waste. We reached the Kirk of Ulpha between
five and six. The appearance of the little farm-house inn at once made
anything approaching to a dinner an impossibility had we wished it ever
so much; but in due time we had tea and boiled ham, with two eggs
apiece, and were much invigorated by this our first Duddonian meal. The
hostess was evidently surprised that we thought of remaining all night,
so humbly did she think of the accommodation she had to offer. She
remembered Mr. Wordsworth sleeping there fifteen years ago, because it
was just after the birth of her daughter, a nice comely girl who
attended us at tea. Mr. Quillinan showed great good nature and
unselfishness in the arrangements he made, and the care he took of the
admirable horse, which I saw him feeding out of a tub, a manger being
too great a refinement for Ulpha.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>After tea, although it was getting dark, we went to the churchyard,
which commands a beautiful view towards Seathwaite, and we then walked
in that direction, through a lane where the walls were more richly
covered by moss and fern than any I ever saw before. A beautiful
dark-coloured tributary to the Duddon comes down from the moors on the
left hand, about a mile from Ulpha; and soon after we had passed the
small bridge over this stream, Mr. Wordsworth recollected a well which
he had discovered some thirty or forty years before. We went off the
road in search of it, through a shadowy, embowered path; and as it was
almost dark we should probably have failed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id="page447"></a>{447}</span> in finding it, had we not
met a very tiny boy, with a can of water in his hand, who looked at us
in speechless amazement, when the Poet said, 'Is there a well here, my
little lad?' We found the well, and then joined the road again by
another path, leaving the child to ponder whether we were creatures of
earth or air.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Saturday morning was cloudy but soft, and lovely in its hazy effects.
When I went out about seven, I saw Wordsworth going a few steps, and
then moving on, and stopping again, in a very abstracted manner; so I
kept back. But when he saw me, he advanced, and took me again to the
churchyard to see the morning effects, which were very lovely. He said
he had not slept well, that the recollection of former days and people
had crowded upon him, and, 'most of all, my dear sister; and when I
thought of her state, and of those who had passed away, Coleridge, and
Southey, and many others, while I am left with all my many infirmities,
if not sins, in full consciousness, how could I sleep? and then I took
to the alteration of sonnets, and that made the matter worse still.'
Then suddenly stopping before a little bunch of harebell, which, along
with some parsley fern, grew out of the wall near us, he exclaimed, 'How
perfectly beautiful that is!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"Would that the little flowers that grow could live,<br /></span>
<span>Conscious of half the pleasure that they give."'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He then expatiated on the inexhaustible beauty of the arrangements of
Nature, its power of combining in the most secret recesses, and that it
must be for some purpose of beneficence that such operations existed.
After breakfast, we got into the cart of the inn, which had a seat swung
into it, upon which a bolster was put, in honour, I presume, of the Poet
Laureate. In this we jogged on to Seathwaite, getting out to ascend a
craggy eminence on the right, which Mrs. Wordsworth admired: the view
from it is very striking. You see from it all the peculiarities of the
vale, the ravine where the Duddon 'deserts the haunts of men,' 'the
spots of stationary sunshine,' and the homesteads which are scattered
here and there, both on the heights and in the lower ground near
protecting rocks and craggy steeps. Seathwaite I had a perfect
recollection of; and the way we approached it twenty years ago, from
Coniston over<span class="pagenum"><a name="page448" id="page448"></a>{448}</span> Walna Scar, is the way Mr. Wordsworth still recommends as
the most beautiful. We went on some distance beyond the chapel, and
every new turning and opening among the hills allured us on, till at
last the Poet was obliged to exercise the word of command, that we
should proceed no further. The return is always a flat thing, so I shall
not detail it, except that we reached our respective homes in good time;
and I hope I shall never cease to think with gratitude and pleasure of
the kindness of my honoured guide through the lovely scenes he has
rescued from obscurity, although it happily still remains an unvitiated
region, 'which stands in no need of the veil of twilight to soften or
disguise its features: as it glistens in the morning's sun it fills the
spectator's heart with gladsomeness.'</p>

<p><i>November 21</i>.&mdash;My mother and I called at Rydal last Saturday, to see
the Wordsworths after their autumnal excursion. We found him only at
home, looking in great vigour and much the better for this little change
of scene and circumstance. He spoke with much interest of a
communication he had had from a benevolent surgeon at Manchester, an
admirer of his, who thinks that a great proportion of the blindness in
this country might be prevented by attention to the diseases of the eye
in childhood. He spoke of two very interesting blind ladies he had seen
at Leamington, one of whom had been at Rydal Mount a short time before
her 'total eclipse,' and now derived the greatest comfort from the
recollection of these beautiful scenes, almost the last she looked on.
He spoke of his own pleasure in returning to them, and of the effect of
the first view from 'Orrest Head,' the point mentioned in his
'unfortunate<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> sonnet, which has,' he said, 'you are aware, exposed
me to the most unlooked for accusations. They actually accuse me of
desiring to interfere with the innocent enjoyments of the poor, by
preventing this district becoming accessible to them by a railway. Now I
deny that it is to that class that this kind of scenery is either the
most improving or the most attractive. For the very poor the great God
of Nature has mercifully spread out His Bible everywhere; the common
sunshine, green fields, the blue sky, the shining river, are everywhere
to be met with in this country; and it is only an individual here and
there among the uneducated classes who feels very deeply the poetry of
lakes and mountains;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>{449}</span> and such persons would rather wander about where
they like, than rush through the country in a railway. It is not,
therefore, the poor, as a class, that would benefit morally or mentally
by a railway conveyance; while to the educated classes, to whom such
scenes as these give enjoyment of the purest kind, the effect would be
almost entirely destroyed.'</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 20th Nov</i>.&mdash;A most remarkable halo was seen round the moon
soon after five o'clock to-day; the colours of the rainbow were most
brilliant, and the circle was entire for about five minutes.</p>

<p>Thursday, Mr. Wordsworth dined here with the Balls, Davys, and Mr.
Jefferies. Mr. W. spoke with much delight of the moon the day before,
and said his servant, whom he called 'dear James,' called his attention
to it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Wednesday, Dec. 18th</i>.&mdash;The Wordsworths and Quillinans sat two hours
with us. He said he thought [Dr. Arnold] was mistaken in the philosophy
of his view of the danger of Milton's Satan being represented without
horns and hoofs; that Milton's conception was as true as it was grand;
that making sin ugly was a common-place notion compared with making it
beautiful outwardly, and inwardly a hell. It assumed every form of
ambition and worldliness, the form in which sin attacks the highest
natures.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This day, Sunday, the 9th of February, the snow is again falling fast,
but very gently. Yesterday, the 8th, was a beautiful day. We had a very
pleasant visit of above an hour from Wordsworth and his wife. He was in
excellent spirits, and repeated with a solemn beauty, quite peculiar to
himself, a sonnet he had lately composed on 'Young England;' and his
indignant burst 'Where then is <i>old</i>, our dear old England?' was one of
the finest bursts of Nature and Art combined I have ever heard. My dear
mother's face, too, while he was repeating it, was a fine addition to
the picture; and I could not help feeling they were both noble specimens
of 'dear old England.' Mrs. Wordsworth, too, is a goodly type of another
class of old England, more thoroughly English perhaps than either of the
others, but they made an admirable trio; and Mrs. Wordsworth's face
expressed more admiration of her husband in his bardic mood than I ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id="page450"></a>{450}</span>saw before. He discussed mesmerism very agreeably, stating strongly his
detestation of clairvoyance; not only on the presumption of its being
altogether false, but supposing it, for argument sake, to be true, then
he thinks it would be an engine of enormous evil, putting it in the
power of any malicious person to blast the character of another, and
shaking to the very foundations the belief in individual responsibility.
He is not disposed to reject without examination the assertions with
regard to the curative powers of mesmerism. He spoke to-day with
pleasure of having heard that Mr. Lockhart had been struck by his lines
from a MSS. poem, printed in his Railway-Sonnet pamphlet.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>February 24th</i>.&mdash;Snow still on the ground. It has never been quite
clear of snow since the 27th January. Partial thaws have allowed us to
peep out into the world of Ambleside and Rydal; and last Saturday we
drank tea at Foxhow, and met the Wordsworths and Miss F&mdash;&mdash;. He is very
happy to have his friend home again, and was in a very agreeable mood.
He repeated his sonnet on the 'Pennsylvanians,' and again that on 'Young
England,' which I admire so much.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>March 6th</i>.&mdash;Wordsworth, whom we met yesterday at dinner at the Oaks,
expressed his dislike to monuments in churches; partly from the
absurdity and falsehood of the epitaphs which sometimes belonged to
them, and partly from their injuring the architectural beauties of the
edifice, as they grievously did in Westminster Abbey and many other
cathedrals. He made an exception in favour of those old knightly
monuments, which he admitted added to the solemnity of the scene, and
were in keeping with the buildings; and he added, 'I must also except
another monument which once made a deep impression on my mind. It was in
a small church near St. Alban's; and I once left London in the
afternoon, so as to sleep at St. Alban's the first night, and have a few
hours of evening light to visit this church. It was before the invention
of railways, and I determined that I would always do the same; but, the
year after, railways existed, and I have never been able to carry out my
project again: all wandering is now over. Well, I went to this small
country church; and just opposite the door at which you enter, the
figure of the great Lord Bacon, in pure white, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>{451}</span> the first thing that
presented itself. I went there to see his tomb, but I did not expect to
see himself; and it impressed me deeply. There he was, a man whose fame
extends over the whole civilised world, sitting calmly, age after age,
in white robes of pure alabaster, in this small country church, seldom
visited except by some stray traveller, he having desired to be interred
in this spot, to lie near his mother.'</p>

<p>On referring to Mallet's Life of Bacon, I see he mentions that he was
privately buried at St. Michael's church, near St. Alban's; and it adds,
'The spot that contains his remains lay obscure and undistinguished,
till the gratitude of a private man, formerly his servant' (Sir Thomas
Meautys), 'erected a monument to his name and memory.' This makes it
probable that the likeness is a correct one.</p>

<p><i>November 8th</i>, 1845.&mdash;On our way to take an early dinner at Foxhow
yesterday, we met the Poet at the foot of his own hill, and he engaged
us to go to tea to the Mount on our way home to hear their adventures,
he and his Mary having just returned from a six weeks' wander among
their friends. During their absence we always feel that the road between
Grasmere and Ambleside is wanting in something, beautiful as it is. We
reached the Mount before six, and found dear Mrs. Wordsworth much
restored by her tour. She has enjoyed the visit to her kith and kin in
Herefordshire extremely, and we had a nice comfortable chat round the
fire and the tea-table. After tea, in speaking of the misfortune it was
when a young man did not seem more inclined to one profession than
another, Wordsworth said that he had always some feeling of indulgence
for men at that age who felt such a difficulty. He had himself passed
through it, and had incurred the strictures of his friends and relations
on this subject. He said that after he had finished his college course,
he was in great doubt as to what his future employment should be. He did
not feel himself good enough for the Church, he felt that his mind was
not properly disciplined for that holy office, and that the struggle
between his conscience and his impulses would have made life a torture.
He also shrank from the law, although Southey often told him that he was
well fitted for the higher parts of the profession. He had studied
military history with great interest, and the strategy of war; and he
always fancied that he had talents for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>{452}</span> command; and he at one time
thought of a military life, but then he was without connections, and he
felt if he were ordered to the West Indies his talents would not save
him from the yellow fever, and he gave that up. At this time he had only
a hundred a year. Upon this he lived, and travelled, and married, for it
was not until the late Lord Lonsdale came into possession that the money
which was due to them was restored. He mentioned this to show how
difficult it often was to judge of what was passing in a young man's
mind, but he thought that for the generality of men, it was much better
that they should be early led to the exercise of a profession of their
own choice.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 1846.&mdash;Henry Fletcher and I dined at the Mount on the 21st of
this month. The party consisted of Mr. Crabb Robinson (their Christmas
guest), Mrs. Arnold, Miss Martineau, and ourselves. My mother's cold was
too bad to allow her to go, which I regretted, as it was, like all their
little meetings, most sociable and agreeable. Wordsworth was much
pleased with a little notice of his new edition in the <i>Examiner</i>; he
thought it very well done. He expressed himself very sweetly at dinner
on the pleasant terms of neighbourly kindness we enjoyed in the valleys.
It will be pleasant in after times to remember his words, and still more
his manner when he said this, it was done with such perfect simplicity
and equality of feeling, without the slightest reference to self, and I
am sure without thinking of himself at the time as more than one of the
little circle whose friendly feeling he was commending.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>October</i> 1846.&mdash;Wordsworth dined with us one day last week, and was in
much greater vigour than I have seen him all this summer.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He mentioned incidentally that the spelling of our language was very
much fixed in the time of Charles the Second, and that the attempts
which had been made since, and are being made in the present day, were
not likely to succeed. He entered his protest as usual against
[Carlyle's] style, and said that since Johnson no writer had done so
much to vitiate the English language. He considers Lord Chesterfield the
last good English writer before Johnson. Then came the Scotch
historians, who did infinite mischief to style, with the exception of
Smollett, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>{453}</span> wrote good pure English. He quite agreed to the saying
that all great poets wrote good prose; he said there was not one
exception. He does not think Burns's prose equal to his verse, but this
he attributes to his writing his letters in English words, while in his
verse he was not trammelled in this way, but let his numbers have their
own way.</p>

<p><i>Lancrigg, November</i>.&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth took an early dinner with
us on the 26th of this month. He was very vigorous, and spoke of his
majority at Glasgow, also of his reception at Oxford. He told us of an
application he had just had from a Glasgow publisher that he should
write a sonnet in praise of Fergusson and Allan Ramsay, to prefix to a
new edition of those Poets which was about to appear. He intended to
reply, that Burns's lines to Fergusson would be a much more appropriate
tribute than anything he could write; and he went on to say that Burns
owed much to Fergusson, and that he had taken the plan of many of his
poems from Fergusson, and the measure also. He did not think this at all
detracted from the merit of Burns, for he considered it a much higher
effort of genius to excel in degree, than to strike out what may be
called an original poem. He spoke highly of the purity of language of
the Scotch poets of an earlier period, Gavin Douglass and others, and
said that they greatly excelled the English poets, after Chaucer, which
he attributed to the distractions of England during the wars of York and
Lancaster.</p>

<p><i>December 25th</i>, 1846.&mdash;My mother and I called at Rydal Mount yesterday
early, to wish our dear friends the blessings of the season. Mrs. W. met
us at the door most kindly, and we found him before his good fire in the
dining-room, with a flock of robins feasting at the window. He had an
old tattered book in his hand; and as soon as he had given us a cordial
greeting, he said, in a most animated manner, 'I must read to you what
Mary and I have this moment finished. It is a passage in the Life of
Thomas Elwood.' He then read to us the following extract:</p>

<p>'Some little time before I went to Alesbury prison, I was desired by my
quondam master, Milton, to take an house for him in the neighbourhood
where I dwell, that he might get out of the city, for the safety of
himself and his family, the pestilence then growing hot in London. I
took a pretty box for him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>{454}</span> Giles-Chalford, a mile from me, of which I
gave him notice; and intended to have waited on him, and seen him well
settled in it, but was prevented by that imprisonment.</p>

<p>'But now being released, and returned home, I soon made a visit to him,
to welcome him into the country.</p>

<p>'After some common discourses had passed between us, he called for a
manuscript of his, which being brought, he delivered to me, bidding me
take it home with me and read it at my leisure; and when I had so done,
return it to him with my judgment thereupon.</p>

<p>'When I came home, and had set myself to read it, I found it was that
excellent poem which he entituled 'Paradise Lost.' After I had with the
best attention read it through, I made him another visit, and returned
him his book with due acknowledgment of the favour he had done me in
communicating it to me. He asked me how I liked it, and what I thought
of it, which I modestly, but freely told him; and after some further
discourse about it, I pleasantly said to him, "Thou hast said much here
of Paradise lost, but what hast thou to say of Paradise found?" He made
me no answer, but sate some time in a muse; then brake off that
discourse, and fell upon another subject. After the sickness was over,
and the city well cleansed and become safely habitable again, he
returned thither; and when afterwards I went to wait on him there (which
I seldom failed of doing whenever my occasions drew me to London), he
showed me his second poem, called "Paradise Regained;" and in a
pleasant tone said to me, "This is owing to you, for you put it into my
head by the question you put to me at Chalford, which before I had not
thought of." <i>But from this digression I return to the family I then
lived in.'</i></p>

<p>Wordsworth was highly diverted with the <i>apology</i> of the worthy Quaker,
for <i>the digression</i>, which has alone saved him from oblivion. He
offered to send us the old book, which came a few days after; and I
shall add another digression in favour of John Milton, to whom he
appears to have been introduced about the year 1661, by a Dr. Paget. It
is thus notified <i>apropos</i> to Thomas Elwood feeling a desire for more
learning than he possessed, which having expressed to Isaac Pennington,
with whom he himself lived as tutor to his children, he says, 'Isaac
Pennington had an intimate acquaintance with Dr. Paget, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id="page455"></a>{455}</span> physician of
note in London, and he with John Milton, a gentleman of great note for
learning throughout the learned world, for the accurate pieces he had
written on various subjects and occasions. This person having filled a
public station in the former times, lived now a private and retired life
in London, and, having wholly lost his sight, kept always a man to read
to him, which usually was the son of some gentleman of his acquaintance,
whom in kindness he took to improve in his learning.</p>

<p>'He received me courteously, as well for the sake of Dr. Paget, who
introduced me, as of Isaac Pennington who recommended me, to both whom
he bore a good respect; and having inquired divers things of me, with
respect to my former progression in learning, he dismissed me to provide
myself of such accommodations as might be most suitable to my future
studies.</p>

<p>'I went, therefore, and took myself a lodging as near to his house,
which was then in Jewin-street, as conveniently I could, and from
thenceforward went every day in the afternoon (except on the first days
of the week), and sitting by him in his dining-room, read to him in such
books in the Latin tongue as he pleased to hear me read.'</p>


<p>(VI.) MRS. DAVY (CONTINUED).</p>

<p>The Oaks, Ambleside, Jan. 15. 1845.</p>

<p>We dined to-day at Rydal Mount. Mr. Wordsworth, during dinner, grave and
silent, till, on some remark having been made on the present condition
of the Church, he most unreservedly gave his own views; and gave
expression, as I have only once heard him give before, to his own
earnest, devout, humble feelings as a Christian. In the evening, being
led by some previous conversation to speak of St. Paul, he said, 'Oh,
what a character that is! how well we know him! How human, yet how
noble! How little outward sufferings moved him! It is not in speaking of
these that he calls himself wretched; it is when he speaks of the inward
conflict. Paul and David,' he said, 'may be called the two Shakspearian
characters in the Bible; both types, as it were, of human nature in its
strength and its weakness. Moses is grand, but then it is chiefly from
position, from the office he had entrusted to him. We do not know Moses
as a man, as a brother man.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page456" id="page456"></a>{456}</span><i>April</i> 7, 1846.&mdash;I went to the Mount to-day, to pay my respects to Mr.
Wordsworth on his birthday. I found him and dear Mrs. Wordsworth very
happy, in the arrival of their four grandsons. The two elder are to go
to Rossall next week. Some talk concerning schools led Mr. Wordsworth
into a discourse, which, in relation to himself, I thought very
interesting, on the dangers of emulation, as used in the way of help to
school progress. Mr. Wordsworth thinks that envy is too likely to go
along with this, and therefore would hold it to be unsafe. 'In my own
case,' he said, 'I never felt emulation with another man but once, and
that was accompanied by envy. It is a horrid feeling.' This 'once' was
in the study of Italian, which, he continued, 'I entered on at college
along with &mdash;&mdash;' (I forget the name he mentioned). 'I never engaged in
the proper studies of the university, so that in these I had no
temptation to envy any one; but I remember with pain that I <i>had</i>
envious feelings when my fellow-student in Italian got before me. I was
his superior in many departments of mind, but he was the better Italian
scholar, and I envied him. The annoyance this gave me made me feel that
emulation was dangerous for <i>me</i>, and it made me very thankful that as a
boy I never experienced it. I felt very early the force of the words,
"Be ye perfect even as your Father in heaven is perfect," and as a
teacher, or friend, or counsellor of youth, I would hold forth no other
motive to exertion than this. There is, I think, none other held forth
in the gospels. No permission is given to emulation there.... There must
always be a danger of incurring the passion of vanity by emulation. If
we try to outstrip a fellow-creature, and succeed, we may naturally
enough be proud. The true lesson of humility is to strive after
conformity to that excellence which we never can surpass, never even by
a great distance attain to.' There was, in the whole manner as well as
matter of Mr. Wordsworth's discourse on this subject, a deep veneration
for the will of God concerning us, which I shall long remember with
interest and delight&mdash;I hope with profit. 'Oh! one other time,' he
added, smiling, 'one other time in my life I felt envy. It was when my
brother was nearly certain of success in a foot race with me. I tripped
up his heels. This <i>must</i> have been envy.'</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">Lesketh How, Jan. 11. 1847.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In a morning visit by our fireside to-day from Mr. Wordsworth, something
led to the mention of Milton, whose poetry, he said, was earlier a
favourite with him than that of Shakspeare. Speaking of Milton's not
allowing his daughters to learn the meaning of the Greek they read to
him, or at least not exerting himself to teach it to them, he admitted
that this seemed to betoken a low estimate of the condition and purposes
of the female mind. 'And yet, where could he have picked up such
notions,' said Mr. W., 'in a country which had seen so many women of
learning and talent? But his opinion of what women ought to be, it may
be presumed, is given in the unfallen Eve, as contrasted with the right
condition of man before his Maker:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"He for God only, she for God in him."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now that,' said Mr. Wordsworth, earnestly, '<i>is</i> a low, a very low and a
very false estimate of woman's condition.' He was amused on my showing
him the (almost) contemporary notice of Milton by Wycherly, and, after
reading it, spoke a good deal of the obscurity of men of genius in or
near their own times. 'But the most singular thing,' he continued, 'is,
that in all the writings of Bacon there is not one allusion to
Shakspeare.'</p>

<p>Lasketh How, Jan. 10. 1849.</p>

<p>A long fireside visit from Mr. Wordsworth this morning, in highly
sociable spirits; speaking much of old days and old acquaintances. He
spoke with much regret of Scott's careless views about money, and said
that he had often spoken to him of the duty of economy, as a means to
insure literary independence. Scott's reply always was, 'Oh, I can make
as much as I please by writing.' 'This,' said Mr. W., 'was marvellous to
me, who had never written a line with a view to profit.' Speaking of his
own prose writing, he said, that but for Coleridge's irregularity of
purpose he should probably have left much more in that kind behind him.
When Coleridge was proposing to publish his 'Friend,' he (Mr.
Wordsworth) offered contributions. Coleridge expressed himself pleased
with the offer, but said, 'I must arrange my principles for the work,
and when that is done I shall be glad of your aid.' But this
'arrangement of principles' never took place. Mr. Wordsworth added, 'I
think my nephew, Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>{458}</span> <i>Conversations and Personal Reminiscences</i>.</p>

<p>Wordsworth,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> will, after my death, collect and publish all I have
written in prose.'</p>

<p>On this day, as I have heard him more than once before, Mr. Wordsworth,
in a way very earnest, and to me very impressive and remarkable,
disclaimed all value for, all concern about, posthumous fame.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<h3><i>(e)</i> CONVERSATIONS AND REMINISCENCES RECORDED BY THE (NOW) BISHOP OF
LINCOLN, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>Remember, first read the ancient classical authors; <i>then</i>come to
<i>us</i>; and you will be able to judge for yourself which of us is worth
reading.</p>

<p>The first book of Homer appears to be independent of the rest. The plan
of the <i>Odyssey</i> is more methodical than that of the <i>Iliad</i>. The
character of Achilles seems to me one of the grandest ever conceived.
There is something awful in it, particularly in the circumstance of his
acting under an abiding foresight of his own death. One day, conversing
with Payne Knight and Uvedale Price concerning Homer, I expressed my
admiration of Nestor's speech, as eminently natural, where he tells the
Greek leaders that <i>they</i> are mere children in comparison with the
heroes of <i>old</i> whom <i>he</i> had known<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>. 'But,' said Knight and Price,
'that passage is spurious.' However, I will not part with it. It is
interesting to compare the same characters (Ajax, for instance) as
treated by Homer, and then afterwards by the Greek dramatists, and to
mark the difference of handling. In the plays of Euripides, politics
come in as a disturbing force: Homer's characters act on physical
impulse. There is more <i>introversion</i> in the dramatist: whence
Aristotle rightly calls him <i>tsagichh&ocirc;tatos</i>. The tower-scene, where
Helen comes into the presence of Priam and the old Trojans, displays one
of the most beautiful pictures anywhere to be seen. Priam's speech<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
on that occasion is a striking proof of the courtesy and delicacy of the
Homeric age, or, at least, of Homer himself.</p>

<p>Catullus translated literally from the Greek; succeeding Roman writers
did not so, because Greek had then become the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page459" id="page459"></a>{459}</span> fashionable, universal
language. They did not translate, but they paraphrased; the ideas
remaining the same, their dress different. Hence the attention of the
poets of the Augustan age was principally confined to the happy
selection of the most appropriate words and elaborate phrases; and hence
arises the difficulty of translating them.</p>

<p>The characteristics ascribed by Horace to Pindar in his ode, 'Pindarum
quisquis,' &amp;c. are not found in his extant writings. Horace had many
lyrical effusions of the Theban bard which we have not. How graceful is
Horace's modesty in his 'Ego <i>apis</i> Matinae More modoque,' as contrasted
with the Dircaean Swan! Horace is my great favourite: I love him dearly.</p>

<p>I admire Virgil's high moral tone: for instance, that sublime 'Aude,
hospes, contemnere opes,' &amp;c. and 'his dantem jura Catonem!' What
courage and independence of spirit is there! There is nothing more
imaginative and awful than the passage,</p>

<p>In describing the weight of sorrow and fear on Dido's mind, Virgil shows
great knowledge of human nature, especially in that exquisite touch of
feeling<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>,</p>

<p>The ministry of Confession is provided to satisfy the natural desire for
some relief from the load of grief. Here, as in so many other respects,
the Church of Rome adapts herself with consummate skill to our nature,
and is strong by our weaknesses. Almost all her errors and corruptions
are abuses of what is good.</p>

<p>I think Buchanan's 'Maiae Calendae' equal in sentiment, if not in
elegance, to anything in Horace; but your brother Charles, to whom I
repeated it the other day, pointed out a false quantity in it<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>.
Happily this had escaped me.</p>

<p>When I began to give myself up to the profession of a poet for life, I
was impressed with a conviction, that there were four English poets whom
I must have continually before me as examples&mdash;Chaucer, Shakspeare,
Spenser, and Milton. These I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>{460}</span> must study, and equal <i>if I could</i>; and I
need not think of the rest<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>.</p>

<p>I have been charged by some with disparaging Pope and Dryden. This is
not so. I have committed much of both to memory. As far as Pope goes, he
succeeds; but his Homer is not Homer, but Pope.</p>

<p>I cannot account for Shakspeare's low estimate of his own writings,
except from the sublimity, the superhumanity, of his genius. They were
infinitely below his conception of what they might have been, and ought
to have been.</p>

<p>The mind often does not think, when it thinks that it is thinking. If we
were to give our whole soul to anything, as the bee does to the flower,
I conceive there would be little difficulty in any intellectual
employment. Hence there is no excuse for obscurity in writing.</p>

<p>'Macbeth,' is the best conducted of Shakspeare's plays. The fault of
'Julius Caesar,' 'Hamlet,' and 'Lear,' is, that the interest is not, and
by the nature of the case could not be, sustained to their conclusion.
The death of Julius Caesar is too <i>overwhelming</i> an incident for <i>any</i>
stage of the drama but the <i>last</i>. It is an incident to which the mind
clings, and from which it will not be torn away to share in other
sorrows. The same may be said of the madness of Lear. Again, the opening
of 'Hamlet' is full of exhausting interest. There is more mind in
'Hamlet' than in any other play, more knowledge of human nature. The
first act is incomparable.... There is too much of an every-day sick
room in the death-bed scene of Catherine, in 'Henry the Eighth'&mdash;too
much of leeches and apothecaries' vials.... 'Zanga' is a bad imitation
of 'Othello.' Garrick never ventured on Othello: he could not submit to
a blacked face. He rehearsed the part once. During the rehearsal Quin
entered, and, having listened for some time with attention, exclaimed,
'Well done, David! but where's the teakettle?' alluding to the print of
Hogarth, where a black boy follows his mistress with a teakettle in his
hand.... In stature Garrick was short.... A fact which conveys a high
notion of his powers is, that he was able to <i>act out</i> the absurd
stage-costume of those days. He represented Coriolanus<span class="pagenum"><a name="page461" id="page461"></a>{461}</span> in the attire of
Cheapside. I remember hearing from Sir G. Beaumont, that while he was
venting, as Lear, the violent paroxysms of his rage in the awful tempest
scene, his wig happened to fall off. The accident did not produce the
slightest effect on the gravity of the house, so strongly had he
impregnated every breast with his own emotions.</p>

<p>Some of my friends (H.C. for instance) doubt whether poetry on
contemporary persons and events can be good. But I instance Spenser's
'Marriage,' and Milton's 'Lycidas.' True, the 'Persae' is one of the
worst of Aeschylus's plays; at least, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Milton is falsely represented by some as a democrat. He was an
aristocrat in the truest sense of the word. See the quotation from him
in my 'Convention of Cintra.'<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Indeed, he spoke in very proud and
contemptuous terms, of the populace. 'Comus' is rich in beautiful and
sweet flowers, and in exuberant leaves of genius; but the ripe and
mellow fruit is in 'Samson Agonistes.' When he wrote that, his mind was
Hebraized. Indeed, his genius fed on the writings of the Hebrew
prophets. This arose, in some degree, from the temper of the times; the
Puritan lived in the Old Testament, almost to the exclusion of the New.</p>

<p>The works of the old English dramatists are the gardens of our language.</p>

<p>One of the noblest things in Milton is the description of that sweet,
quiet morning in the 'Paradise Regained,' after that terrible night of
howling wind and storm. The contrast is divine.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>What a virulent democrat &mdash;&mdash; is! A man ill at ease with his own
conscience is sure to quarrel with all government, order, and law.</p>

<p>The influence of Locke's Essay was not due to its own merits, which are
considerable; but to external circumstances. It came forth at a happy
opportunity, and coincided with the prevalent opinions of the time. The
Jesuit doctrines concerning the papal power in deposing kings, and
absolving subjects from their allegiance, had driven some Protestant
theologians to take refuge in the theory of the divine right of kings.
This<span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id="page462"></a>{462}</span> theory was unpalatable to the world at large, and others invented
the more popular doctrine of a social contract, in its place; a doctrine
which history refutes. But Locke did what he could to accommodate this
principle to his own system.</p>

<p>The only basis on which property can rest is right derived from
prescription.</p>

<p>The best of Locke's works, as it seems to me, is that in which he
attempts the least&mdash;his <i>Conduct of the Understanding</i>.</p>

<p>In the Summer of 1827, speaking of some of his contemporaries,
Wordsworth said, T. Moore has great natural genius; but he is too lavish
of brilliant ornament. His poems smell of the perfumer's and milliner's
shops. He is not content with a ring and a bracelet, but he must have
rings in the ears, rings on the nose&mdash;rings everywhere.</p>

<p>Walter Scott is not a careful composer. He allows himself many
liberties, which betray a want of respect for his reader. For instance,
he is too fond of inversions; <i>i.e.</i> he often places the verb before the
substantive, and the accusative before the verb. W. Scott quoted, as
from me,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'The swan on <i>sweet</i> St. Mary's lake<br /></span>
<span>Floats double, swan and shadow,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>instead of <i>still</i>; thus obscuring my idea, and betraying his own
uncritical principles of composition.</p>

<p>Byron seems to me deficient in <i>feeling</i>. Professor Wilson, I think,
used to say that 'Beppo' was his best poem; because all his faults were
there brought to a height. I never read the 'English Bards' through. His
critical prognostications have, for the most part, proved erroneous.</p>

<p>Sir James Mackintosh said of me to M. de Sta&euml;l, Wordsworth is not a
great poet, but he is the greatest man among poets.' Madame de Sta&euml;l
complained of my style.</p>

<p>Now whatever may be the result of my experiment in the subjects which I
have chosen for poetical composition&mdash;be they vulgar or be they not,&mdash;I
can say without vanity, that I have bestowed great pains on my <i>style</i>,
full as much as any of my contemporaries have done on theirs. I yield to
none in <i>love for my art</i>. I, therefore, labour at it with reverence,
affection, and industry. My main endeavour as to style has been that my
poems should be written in pure intelligible English. Lord Byron<span class="pagenum"><a name="page463" id="page463"></a>{463}</span> has
spoken severely of my compositions. However faulty they may be, I do not
think that I ever could have prevailed upon myself to print such lines
as he has done; for instance,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'I stood at Venice on the Bridge of Sighs,<br /></span>
<span>A palace and a prison on each hand.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some person ought to write a critical review, analysing Lord Byron's
language, in order to guard others against imitating him in these
respects.</p>

<p>Shelley is one of the best <i>artists</i> of us all: I mean in workmanship of
style.</p>

<p>At Calgarth, dining with Mrs. and the Miss Watsons ... a very fine
portrait of the late Bishop in the dining-room.... Mr. Wordsworth there:
a very agreeable party. Walked home with him in the evening to Rydal. It
rained all the way. We met a poor woman in the road. She sobbed as she
passed us. Mr. Wordsworth was much affected with her condition: she was
swollen with dropsy, and slowly hobbling along with a stick, having been
driven from one lodging to another. It was a dark stormy night. Mr.
Wordsworth brought her back to the Lowwood Inn, where, by the landlord's
leave, she was housed in one of his barns.</p>

<p>One day I met Mr. M.T. Sadler at the late Archbishop's. Sadler did not
know me; and before dinner he began to launch forth in a critical
dissertation on contemporary English Poetry. 'Among living poets, your
Grace may know there is one called Wordsworth, whose writings the world
calls childish and puerile, but I think some of them wonderfully
pathetic.' 'Now, Mr. Sadler,' said the Archbishop, 'what a scrape you
are in! here is Mr. Wordsworth: but go down with him to dinner, and you
will find that, though a great poet, he does not belong to the "genus
irritabile."' This was very happy.</p>

<p>After returning one day from church at Addington, I took the liberty of
saying a few words on the sermon we had heard. It was a very homely
performance. 'I am rather surprised, my Lord Archbishop, that when your
Grace can have the choice of so many preachers in England, you do not
provide better for yourself.' 'Oh!' said he, 'I think I can bear bad
preaching better than most people, and I therefore keep it to myself.'
This<span class="pagenum"><a name="page464" id="page464"></a>{464}</span> seemed to me a very pleasing trait in the gentle and loveable
character of that admirable man.</p>

<p>Patriarchal usages have not quite deserted us of these valleys. This
morning (new year's day) you were awakened early by the minstrels
playing under the eaves, 'Honour to Mr. Wordsworth!' 'Honour to Mrs.
Wordsworth!' and so to each member of the household by name, servants
included, each at his own window. These customs bind us together as a
family, and are as beneficial as they are delightful. May they never
disappear!</p>

<p>In my Ode on the 'Intimations of Immortality in Childhood,' I do not
profess to give a literal representation of the state of the affections
and of the moral being in childhood. I record my own feelings at that
time&mdash;my absolute spirituality, my 'all-soulness,' if I may so speak. At
that time I could not believe that I should lie down quietly in the
grave, and that my body would moulder into dust.</p>

<p>Many of my poems have been influenced by my own circumstances when I was
writing them. 'The Warning' was composed on horseback, while I was
riding from Moresby in a snow-storm. Hence the simile in that poem,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'While thoughts press on and feelings overflow,<br /></span>
<span>And quick words round him fall like <i>flakes of snow</i>.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the 'Ecclesiastical Sonnets,' the lines concerning the Monk (Sonnet
xxi.),</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'Within his cell.<br /></span>
<span>Round the decaying trunk of human pride.<br /></span>
<span>At morn, and eve, and midnight's silent hour,<br /></span>
<span>Do penitential cogitations cling:<br /></span>
<span>Like ivy round some ancient elm they twine<br /></span>
<span>In grisly folds and strictures serpentine;<br /></span>
<span>Yet while they strangle, a fair growth they bring<br /></span>
<span>For recompence&mdash;their own perennial bower;'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>were suggested to me by a beautiful tree clad as thus described, which
you may remember in Lady Fleming's park at Rydal, near the path to the
upper waterfall.</p>

<p>S&mdash;&mdash;, in the work you mentioned to me, confounds <i>imagery</i> and
<i>imagination</i>. Sensible objects really existing, and felt to exist, are
<i>imagery</i>; and they may form the materials of a descriptive poem, where
objects are delineated as they are. Imagination is a subjective term: it
deals with objects not as they are, but as they appear to the mind of
the poet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>{465}</span></p>

<p>The imagination is that intellectual lens through the medium of which
the poetical observer sees the objects of his observation, modified both
in form and colour; or it is that inventive dresser of dramatic
<i>tableaux</i>, by which the persons of the play are invested with new
drapery, or placed in new attitudes; or it is that chemical faculty by
which elements of the most different nature and distant origin are
blended together into one harmonious and homogeneous whole.</p>

<p>A beautiful instance of the modifying and <i>investive</i> power of
imagination may be seen in that noble passage of Dyer's 'Ruins of
Rome,'<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> where the poet hears the voice of Time; and in Thomson's
description of the streets of Cairo, expecting the arrival of the
caravan which had perished in the storm,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>Read all Cowley; he is very valuable to a collector of English sound
sense.... Burns's 'Scots wha hae' is poor as a lyric composition.</p>

<p>Ariosto and Tasso are very absurdly depressed in order to elevate Dante.
Ariosto is not always sincere; Spenser always so.</p>

<p>I have tried to read Goethe. I never could succeed. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; refers me
to his 'Iphigenia,' but I there recognise none of the dignified
simplicity, none of the health and vigour which the heroes and heroines
of antiquity possess in the writings of Homer. The lines of Lucretius
describing the immolation of Iphigenia are worth the whole of Goethe's
long poem. Again, there is a profligacy, an inhuman sensuality, in his
works which is utterly revolting. I am not intimately acquainted with
them generally. But I take up my ground on the first canto of 'Wilhelm
Meister;' and, as the attorney-general of human nature, I there indict
him for wantonly outraging the sympathies of humanity. Theologians tell
us of the degraded nature of man; and they tell us what is true. Yet man
is essentially a moral agent, and there is that immortal and
unextinguishable yearning for something pure and spiritual which will
plead against these poetical sensualists as long as man remains what he
is.</p>

<p>Scientific men are often too fond of aiming to be men of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page466" id="page466"></a>{466}</span> world.
They crave too much for titles, and stars, and ribbons. If Bacon had
dwelt only in the court of Nature, and cared less for that of James the
First, he would have been a greater man, and a happier one too.</p>

<p>I heard lately from young Mr. Watt a noble instance of magnanimity in an
eminent French chemist. He had made a discovery, which he was informed
would, if he took out a patent, realise a large fortune. 'No,' said he,
'I do not live to amass money, but to discover Truth; and as long as she
attends me in my investigations so long will I serve her and her only.'</p>

<p>Sir &mdash;&mdash; I know from my own experience was ruined by prosperity. The age
of Leo X. would have shone with greater brilliance if it had had more
clouds to struggle with. The age of Louis XIV. was formed by the Port
Royal amid the storms and thunders of the League. Racine lived in a
court till it became necessary to his existence, as his miserable death
proved. Those petty courts of Germany have been injurious to its
literature. They who move in them are too prone to imagine themselves to
be the whole world, and compared with the whole world they are nothing
more than these little specks in the texture of this hearth-rug.</p>

<p>As I was riding Dora's pony from Rydal to Cambridge, I got off, as I
occasionally did, to walk. I fell in with a sweet-looking peasant girl
of nine or ten years old. She had been to carry her father's dinner, who
was working in the fields, and she was wheeling a little wheelbarrow, in
which she collected manure from the roads for her garden at home. After
some talk I gave her a penny, for which she thanked me in the sweetest
way imaginable. I wish I had asked her whether she could read, and
whether she went to school. But I could not help being struck with the
happy arrangement which Nature has made for the education of the heart,
an arrangement which it seems the object of the present age to
counteract instead of to cherish and confirm. I imagined the happy
delight of the father in seeing his child at a distance, and watching
her as she approached to perform her errand of love. I imagined the joy
of the mother in seeing her return. I am strongly of opinion (an opinion
you, perhaps, have seen expressed by me in a letter to Mr. Rose<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>)
that this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page467" id="page467"></a>{467}</span> the discipline which is more calculated by a thousand
degrees to make a virtuous and happy nation than the all-engrossing,
estranging, eleemosynary institutions for education, which perhaps
communicate more <i>knowledge</i>. In these institutions what the pupils gain
in <i>knowledge</i> they often lose in <i>wisdom</i>. This is a distinction which
must never be lost sight of.</p>

<p>Education should never be wholly eleemosynary. But must the parent
suffer privations for the sake of the child? Yes; for these privations
endear the child to the parent, and the parent to the child; and
whatever education the parent may thus gain or lose for his child, he
has thus gained the noblest result of the most liberal education for
himself&mdash;the habit of self-denial.</p>

<p>Next to your principles, and affections, and health, value your
time.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<h3><a name="GRAVES" id="GRAVES"></a>(<i>f</i>) REMINISCENCES OF THE REV. R.P. GRAVES, M.A., FORMERLY OF
WINDERMERE, NOW OF DUBLIN.</h3>

<p>I remember Mr. Wordsworth saying that, at a particular stage of his
mental progress, he used to be frequently so rapt into an unreal
transcendental world of ideas that the external world seemed no longer
to exist in relation to him, and he had to reconvince himself of its
existence <i>by clasping a tree</i>, or something that happened to be near
him. I could not help connecting this fact with that obscure passage in
his great Ode on the 'Intimations of Immortality,' in which he speaks of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">'Those obstinate questionings<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of sense and outward things;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fallings from us, vanishings:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blank misgivings of a creature,<br /></span>
<span>Moving about in worlds not realised,' &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I heard him once make the remark that it would be a good habit to watch
closely the first involuntary thoughts upon waking in the morning, as
indications of the real current of the moral being.</p>

<p>I was struck by what seemed to me a beautiful analogy, which I once
heard him draw, and which was new to me&mdash;that the individual characters
of mankind showed themselves distinctively in childhood and youth, as
those of trees in Spring;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page468" id="page468"></a>{468}</span> that of both, of trees in Summer and of human
kind in middle life, they were then alike to a great degree merged in a
dull uniformity; and that again, in Autumn and in declining age, there
appeared afresh all their original and inherent variety brought out into
view with deeper marking of character, with more vivid contrast, and
with greater accession of interest and beauty.</p>

<p>He thought the charm of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> mistakenly ascribed, as it
commonly is done, to its <i>naturalness</i>. Attaching a full value to the
singular yet easily imagined and most picturesque circumstances of the
adventurer's position, to the admirable painting of the scenes, and to
the knowledge displayed of the working of human feelings, he yet felt
sure that the intense interest created by the story arose chiefly from
the extraordinary energy and resource of the hero under his difficult
circumstances, from their being so far beyond what it was natural to
expect, or what would have been exhibited by the average of men; and
that similarly the high pleasure derived from his successes and good
fortunes arose from the peculiar source of these uncommon merits of his
character.</p>

<p>I have heard him pronounce that the Tragedy of <i>Othello</i>, Plato's
records of the last scenes of the career of Socrates, and Isaac Walton's
<i>Life of George Herbert</i>, were in his opinion the most pathetic of human
compositions.</p>

<p>In a walk one day, after stopping, according to his custom, to claim
admiration for some happy aspect of the landscape, or beautiful
<i>composition</i> on a smaller scale of natural objects, caught by him at
the precisely best point of view in the midst of his conversation on
other subjects, he added, good-humouredly, that there were three
callings for success in which Nature had furnished him with
qualifications&mdash;the callings of poet, landscape-gardener, and critic of
pictures and works of art. On hearing this I could not but remember how
his qualifications for the second were proved by the surprising variety
of natural beauties he managed to display to their best advantage, from
the very circumscribed limits of the garden at Rydal Mount, 'an
invisible hand of art everywhere working' (to use his own exquisite
expression) 'in the very spirit of Nature,' and how many there were who
have owed the charm of their grounds and gardens to direction sought
from his well-known taste and feeling. As to works of art, his criticism
was not that of one versed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page469" id="page469"></a>{469}</span> the history of the schools, but, always
proceeding upon first principles, the 'prima philosophia,' as he called
it; and it was, as it appeared to me, of the highest order.</p>

<p>He was a very great admirer of <i>Virgil</i>, not so much as a creative poet,
but as the most consummate master of language, that, perhaps, ever
existed. From him, and Horace, who was an especial favourite, and
Lucretius, he used to quote much.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<h3><a name="DEATH" id="DEATH">(<i>g</i>) ON THE DEATH OF COLERIDGE.</a></h3>

<p>The death of Coleridge was announced to us by his friend Wordsworth. It
was the Sunday evening after the event occurred that my brother and I
walked over to the Mount, where we found the Poet alone. One of the
first things we heard from him was the death of one who had been, he
said, his friend for more than thirty years. He then continued to speak
of him; called him the most <i>wonderful</i> man that he had ever
known&mdash;wonderful for the originality of his mind, and the power he
possessed of throwing out in profusion grand central truths from which
might be evolved the most comprehensive systems. Wordsworth, as a poet,
regretted that German metaphysics had so much captivated the taste of
Coleridge, for he was frequently not intelligible on this subject;
whereas, if his energy and his originality had been more exerted in the
channel of poetry, an instrument of which he had so perfect a mastery,
Wordsworth thought he might have done more permanently to enrich the
literature, and to influence the thought of the nation, than any man of
the age. As it was, however, he said he believed Coleridge's mind to
have been a widely fertilising one, and that the seed he had so lavishly
sown in his conversational discourses, and the Sibylline leaves (not the
poems so called by him) which he had scattered abroad so extensively
covered with his annotations, had done much to form the opinions of the
highest-educated men of the day; although this might be an influence not
likely to meet with adequate recognition. After mentioning, in answer to
our inquiries about the circumstances of their friendship, that though a
considerable period had elapsed during which they had not seen much of
each other, Coleridge and he had been, for more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="page470" id="page470"></a>{470}</span> two years,
uninterruptedly, in as close intimacy as man could be with man, he
proceeded to read to us the letter from Henry Nelson Coleridge which
conveyed the tidings of his great relation's death, and of the manner of
it. It appeared that, his death was a relief from intense pain, which,
however, subsided at the interval of a few days before the event; and
that shortly after this cessation of agony, he fell into a comatose
state. The most interesting part of the letter was the statement, that
the last use he made of his faculties was to call his children and other
relatives and friends around him, to give them his blessing, and to
express his hope to them that the manner of his end might manifest the
depth of his trust in his Saviour Christ. As I heard this, I was at once
deeply glad at the substance, and deeply affected by Wordsworth's
emotion in reading it. When he came to this part his voice at first
faltered, and then broke; but soon divine faith that the change was a
blest one overcame aught of human grief, and he concluded in an equable
though subdued tone. Before I quit this subject, I will tell you what I
was interested in hearing from a person of the highest abilities,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
whom I had the good fortune of meeting at Rydal Mount. He said that he
had visited Coleridge about a month before his death, and had perceived
at once his countenance pervaded by a most remarkable serenity. On being
congratulated on his appearance, Coleridge replied that he did now, for
the first time, begin to hope, from the mitigation of his pains, that
his health was undergoing a permanent improvement (alas! he was
deceived; yet may we not consider this hopeful feeling, which is, I
believe, by no means uncommon, to be under such circumstances a valuable
blessing?); but that what he felt most thankful for was the deep, calm
peace of mind which he then enjoyed; a peace such as he had never before
experienced, or scarcely hoped for. This, he said, seemed now settled
upon him; and all things were thus looked at by him through an
atmosphere by which all were <i>reconciled and harmonised</i>.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>I remember to have been very much struck by what appeared to me the
wisdom of a plan suggested by Wordsworth, for the revision of the
authorised version of the Bible and of the Book of Common Prayer.</p>

<p>With regard to the former, no one, he said, could be more deeply
convinced of the inestimable value of its having been made when it was,
and being what it is. In his opinion it was made at the happy juncture
when our language had attained adequate expansion and flexibility, and
when at the same time its idiomatic strength was unimpaired by excess of
technical distinctions and conventional refinements; and these
circumstances, though of course infinitely subordinate to the spiritual
influence of its subject-matter, he considered to be highly important in
connection with a volume which naturally became a universally recognised
standard of the language; for thus the fresh well of English undefiled
was made a perennial blessing to the nation, in no slight degree
conducive to the robust and manly thinking and character of its
inhabitants. He was satisfied, too, as to its general and most impartial
accuracy, and its faithfulness in rendering not only the words but the
style, the strength, and the spirit and the character of the original
records. He attached too the value one might suppose he would attach to
the desirableness of leaving undisturbed the sacred associations which
to the feelings of aged Christians belonged to the <i>ipsissima verba</i>
which had been their support under the trials of life.</p>

<p>And so with regard to the Prayer Book, he reverenced and loved it as the
Church's precious heritage of primitive piety, equally admirable for its
matter and its style. It may be interesting to add, that in reference to
this latter point I have heard him pronounce that many of the collects
seemed to him examples of perfection, consisting, according to his
impression, of words whose signification filled up without excess or
defect the simple and symmetrical contour of some majestic meaning, and
whose sound was a harmony of accordant simplicity and grandeur; a
combination, he added, such as we enjoy in some of the best passages of
Shakespeare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page472" id="page472"></a>{472}</span></p>

<p>But notwithstanding that he held these opinions, which will evince that
he was not one who would lightly touch either sacred volume, he did not
think that plain mistakes in the translation of the Bible, or obsolete
words, or renderings commonly misunderstood, should be perpetually
handed down in our authorised version of the volume of inspiration, or
that similar blemishes in the Prayer Book, which, as being of human
composition, would admit of freer though still reverential handling,
should be permitted to continue as stumbling-blocks interfering with its
acceptableness and usefulness.</p>

<p>The plan which he suggested as meeting the difficulties of the case was
the following:</p>

<p>That by proper authority a Committee of Revision of the English Bible
should be appointed, whose business should be, retaining the present
authorised version as a standard to be departed from as little as
possible to settle upon such indubitable corrections of meaning and
improvements of expression as they agreed ought to be made, and have
these printed <i>in the margin</i> of all Bibles published by authority.
That, as an essential part of the scheme, this Committee of Revision
should be renewed periodically, but not too frequently&mdash;he appeared to
think that periods of fifty years might serve&mdash;at which times it should
be competent to the Committee to authorise the transference from the
margin into the text of all such alterations as had stood the test of
experience and criticism during the previous period, as well as to fix
on new marginal readings.</p>

<p>He was of opinion that in the constitution of the Committee care should
be taken to appoint not only divines of established reputation for sound
theology, and especially for their knowledge in connection with the
original languages of the sacred volume, but some one author at least
noted for his mastery over the vernacular language.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this plan, while it provides for corrections of
errors and substitution of understood for obsolete or mistaken
expressions, leaves undisturbed the associations of aged Christians, and
prepares the younger generation for receiving the marginal amendments
into the text. Wordsworth conceived that fixing the duration of the
period of revision was of great consequence, both as obviating all
agitation in the way of call for such a process, and as tending in the
matter of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page473" id="page473"></a>{473}</span>critical discussions respecting the sanctioning, cancelling,
and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness
in preparation for each era of revision.</p>

<p>The same process, under certain modifications, he thought applicable to
the Book of Common Prayer. In this he deprecated all tampering with
doctrine, considering that alterations ought to be confined to changes
rendering the services more clearly understood or more conveniently
used. It is fair to add, however, that I have heard him express a strong
desire that the Athanasian Creed were rid of the so-called damnatory
clauses; at the same time declaring that no one was ever more profoundly
convinced than himself of the truth of the doctrine of the Trinity.</p>

<p>He was in favour of a collection of metrical hymns, more peculiarly
Christian in character than the Psalter, being set forth by authority
for use in the Church; and for the choice of such hymns he thought a
Committee should be appointed in which the knowledge of divine, of poet,
and of laymen trusted for common sense and experience in life should be
severally and conjointly engaged. As a practical suggestion of moment in
the <i>composition</i> of such hymns he advised that composers should not in
the four-line stanza do more than make the second and fourth lines
rhyme; leaving the other two unrhymed, he said, would give an important
addition of freedom both to the sense and the style.</p>

<p>R.P. GRAVES. Windermere, 1850.</p>

<p>To the above memorandum I now (Sept. 1874) add two items, of which I
retain a distinct remembrance.</p>

<p>(1) He was in favour of the officiating clergyman being allowed to
introduce into his reading of the Lessons in church the authorised
marginal corrections.</p>

<p>(2) He expressed in very strong terms his opinion that the prefatory
portion of the Marriage Service should be altered so as to make it not
only less repulsive to modern feelings, but more accordant with the
higher aspects of the union to be solemnised.</p>

<p><i>Passion in Poetry</i>.&mdash;One day, speaking of passion as an element of
poetry, he referred to his own poems, and said that he thought there was
a stronger fire of passion than was elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>{474}</span> to be found among them in
the lyrical burst near the conclusion of 'The Song at the Feast of
Brougham Castle:'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Armour rusting in his halls,<br /></span>
<span>On the blood of Clifford calls:<br /></span>
<span>"Quell the Scot," exclaims the Lance&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>"Bear me to the heart of France,"<br /></span>
<span>Is the longing of the Shield.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Chronological Classification of Poems</i>.&mdash;Many years ago I expressed to
Wordsworth a wish that his poems were printed in the order of their
composition, assigning as reasons for the wish the great interest which
would attach to observing the progressive development of the poet's
thought, and the interpretative value of the light mutually reflected by
poems of the same period. I remember being surprised by the feeling akin
to indignation which he manifested at the suggestion. He said that such
proceeding would indicate on the part of a poet an amount of egotism,
placing interest in himself above interest in the subjects treated by
him, which could not belong to a true poet caring for the elements of
poetry in their right proportion, and designing to bring to bear upon
the minds of his readers the best influences at his command in the way
best calculated to make them effectual. I felt that his ground of
objection made me revere him the more both as a man and as a poet; yet I
retained the opinion that much might be said on the reader's part in the
case of a great poet for such an arrangement of his poems as I had been
suggesting, and I welcomed in after-days the concession made by him in
consenting to put dates to the poems, while adhering to their
classification according to subject or predominant element.</p>

<p><i>Verbal Criticism</i>.&mdash;Wordsworth not only sympathised with the feelings
expressed in Southey's touching lines upon The Dead, but admired very
much the easy flow of the verse and the perfect freedom from strain in
the expression by which they are marked. Yet in the first two stanzas he
noted three flaws, and suggested changes by which they might have been
easily avoided. I have underlined the words he took exception to:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'My days among the dead are past;<br /></span>
<span>Around me I behold,<br /></span>
</div></div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page475" id="page475"></a>{475}</span>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Where'er <i>these casual eyes</i> are cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The mighty minds of old;<br /></span>
<span>My never-failing friends are they,<br /></span>
<span>With whom I <i>converse</i> day by day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>With them I take delight in weal,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And seek relief in woe;<br /></span>
<span>And while I understand and feel<br /></span>
<span class="i4">How much to them I owe,<br /></span>
<span>My cheeks have often been bedew'd<br /></span>
<span>With tears of thoughtful gratitude.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the first stanza, for 'Where'er <i>these casual eyes</i> are cast,' which
he objected to as not simple and natural, and as scarcely correct, he
suggested 'Where'er <i>a casual look I cast</i>;' and for '<i>converse</i>,' the
accent of which he condemned as belonging to the noun and not to the
verb, he suggested '<i>commune</i>.' In the second stanza he pointed out the
improper sequence of tenses in the third and fifth lines, which he
corrected by reading in the latter '<i>My cheeks are oftentimes bedew'd</i>.'
Of the narrative poems of his friend, well executed as he considered
them, and of the mainly external action of imagination or fancy in which
they deal, I have certainly heard him pronounce a very depreciatory
opinion; whether I ever heard him use the hard words attributed to him,
'I would not give five shillings for a ream of them,' I cannot now
assert, but if used, they were said in reference to the nobler kind of
imaginative power which reveals to man the deep places and sublimer
affinities of his own being. But to some others of Southey's verses, as
well as to the lines above quoted, and to his prose writings in general,
he was wont to give liberal praise; and no one could doubt the sincerity
and warmth of his admiration of the intellect and virtues of the man, or
the brotherly affection towards him which he not unfrequently expressed.</p>

To PROFESSOR HENRY REED.</div>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">Philadelphia, Sept. 1850.</span><br />
<br />
<p>MY DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p>You have asked me to write out as fully as I can an account of my visit
to Wordsworth last Summer, of which your letter of introduction was the
occasion. Feeling very grateful to you for the pleasure which that visit
gave me, and desiring to make a more minute record of it than either the
letter I addressed to you from Keswick, or my journal written at the
time contains, I gladly comply with your request.</p>

<p>It was about noon on the 18th of August 1849, that I set out with my
friends, from their house near Bowness, to ride to Ambleside. Our route
was along the shore of Lake Windermere. It was my first day among the
English Lakes, and I enjoyed keenly the loveliness which was spread out
before me. My friends congratulated me on the clearness of the
atmosphere and the bright skies. Twilight is all-important in bringing
out the full beauty of the Lake Region, and in this respect I was very
fortunate. I had already been deeply moved by the tranquil beauty of
Windermere, for, as I came out of the cottage, formerly Professor
Wilson's, where I had passed the night, there it lay in all its
grandeur, its clear waters, its green islands, and its girdle of solemn
mountains. It was quite dark when I had been conducted to this cottage
the night before, so that I saw the Lake for the first time in the light
of early morning. The first impression was confirmed by every new
prospect as we rode along. The vale seemed a very paradise for its sweet
seclusion. I had been told that after Switzerland, I should find little
to attract me in this region, but such was not the case. Nothing can be
more lovely than these lakes and mountains, the latter thickly wooded,
and rising directly from the water's edge. The foliage is of the darkest
green, giving to the lake in which it is reflected the same sombre hue.
It seemed the fittest dwelling-place for a Poet, amid all this quiet
beauty.</p>

<p>It was half-past one when we reached Ambleside, where I left Mr. and
Mrs. B., and walked on alone to Rydal Mount. I was full of eager
expectations as I thought how soon I should, perhaps, be in the presence
of Wordsworth&mdash;that after long years<span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id="page477"></a>{477}</span> of waiting, of distant reverential
admiration and love, I was, as I hoped, to be favoured with a personal
interview with the great poet-philosopher, to whom you and I, and so
many, many others, feel that we are under the deepest obligation for the
good which has come to us from his writings. At two o'clock I was at the
wicket gate opening into Wordsworth's grounds. I walked along the gravel
pathway, leading through shrubbery to the open space in front of the
long two-story cottage, the Poet's dwelling. Your sketch of the house by
Inman is a correct one, but it gives no idea of the view <i>from</i> it,
which is its chief charm. Rydal Mere with its islands, and the mountains
beyond it, are all in sight. I had but a hasty enjoyment of this beauty;
nor could I notice carefully the flowers which were blooming around. It
was evident that the greatest attention had been paid to the grounds,
for the flower-beds were tastefully arranged, and the gravel walks were
in complete order. One might be well content, I thought, to make his
abode at a spot like this.</p>

<p>A boy of about twelve years was occupied at one of the flower-beds, as I
passed by; he followed me to the door, and waited my commands. I asked
if Mr. Wordsworth was in.... He was dining&mdash;would I walk into the
drawing-room, and wait a short time?... I was shown into the
drawing-room, or study, I know not which to call it.... Here I am, I
said to myself, in the great Poet's house. Here his daily life is spent.
Here in this room, doubtless, much of his poetry has been written&mdash;words
of power which are to go down with those of Shakspeare, and Spenser, and
Milton, while our English tongue endures. It was a long apartment, the
ceiling low, with two windows at one end, looking out on the lawn and
shrubbery. Many engravings were on the walls. The famous Madonna of
Raphael, known as that of the Dresden Gallery, hung directly over the
fire-place. Inman's portrait of the Poet, your gift to Mrs. Wordsworth,
being a copy of the one painted for you, had a conspicuous place. The
portrait of Bishop White, also your gift (the engraving from Inman's
picture), I also noticed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I could have waited patiently for a long time indulging the thoughts
which the place called up. In a few minutes, however, I heard steps in
the entry, the door was opened, and Wordsworth came in, it could be no
other&mdash;- a tall figure, a little bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="page478" id="page478"></a>{478}</span> with age, his hair thin and grey,
and his face deeply wrinkled.... The expression of his countenance was
sad, mournful I might say; he seemed one on whom sorrow pressed heavily.
He gave me his hand, and welcomed me cordially, though without smiling.
'Will you walk out, Sir, and join us at the table?' said he. 'I am
engaged to dine elsewhere.' 'But you can sit with us,' said he; so,
leading the way, he conducted me to the dining-room. At the head of the
table sat Mrs. Wordsworth, and their three grandchildren made up the
party.... It was a humble apartment, not ceiled, the rafters being
visible; having a large old-fashioned chimney-place, with a high
mantelpiece.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Wordsworth asked after Mr. Ticknor of Boston, who had visited him a few
months before, and for whom he expressed much regard. Some other
questions led me to speak of the progress we were making in America in
the extension of our territory, the settlements on the Pacific, &amp;c.; all
this involving the rapid spread of our English tongue. Wordsworth at
this looked up, and I noticed a fixing of his eye as if on some remote
object. He said that considering this extension of our language, it
behoved those who wrote to see to it, that what they put forth was on
the side of virtue. This remark, although thrown out at the moment, was
made in a serious thoughtful way; and I was much impressed by it. I
could not but reflect that to him a deep sense of responsibility had
ever been present: to purify and elevate has been the purpose of all his
writings. Such may have been at that moment his own inward meditation,
and he may have had in mind the coming generations who are to dwell upon
his words.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Queen Victoria was mentioned&mdash;her visit to Ireland which had just been
made&mdash;the courage she had shown. 'That is a virtue,' said he, 'which she
has to a remarkable degree, which is very much to her credit.'</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Inman's portrait of him I alluded to as being very familiar to me, the
copy which hung in the room calling it to mind, which led him to speak
of the one painted by Pickersgill for St. John's College, Cambridge. 'I
was a member of that College,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page479" id="page479"></a>{479}</span> he said, 'and the fellows and students
did me the honour to ask me to sit, and allowed me to choose the artist.
I wrote to Mr. Rogers on the subject, and he recommended Pickersgill,
who came down soon afterwards, and the picture was painted here.' He
believed he had sat twenty-three times. My impression is he was in doubt
whether Inman's or Pickersgill's portrait was the better one.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He spoke with great animation of the advantage of classical study, Greek
especially. 'Where,' said he, 'would one look for a greater orator than
Demosthenes; or finer dramatic poetry, next to Shakspeare, than that of
Aeschylus and Sophocles, not to speak of Euripides?' Herodotus he
thought 'the most interesting and instructive book, next to the Bible,
which had ever been written.' Modern discoveries had only tended to
confirm the general truth of his narrative. Thucydides he thought less
of.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>France was our next subject, and one which seemed very near his heart.
He had been much in that country at the out-break of the Revolution, and
afterwards during its wildest excesses. At the time of the September
massacres he was at Orleans. Addressing Mrs. W. he said, 'I wonder how I
came to stay there so long, and at a period so exciting.' He had known
many of the abb&eacute;s and other ecclesiastics, and thought highly of them as
a class; they were earnest, faithful men: being unmarried, he must say,
they were the better able to fulfil their sacred duties; they were
married to their flocks. In the towns there seemed, he admitted, very
little religion; but in the country there had always been a great deal.
'I should like to spend another month in France,' he said, 'before I
close my eyes.' He seemed to feel deep commiseration for the sorrows of
that unhappy country. It was evidently the remembrance of hopes which in
his youth he had ardently cherished, and which had been blighted, on
which his mind was dwelling. I alluded to Henry the Fifth, to whom many
eyes were, I thought, beginning to turn. With him, he remarked, there
would be a principle for which men could contend&mdash;legitimacy. The
advantage of this he stated finely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page480" id="page480"></a>{480}</span></p>

<p>There was tenderness, I thought, in the tones of his voice, when
speaking with his wife; and I could not but look with deep interest and
admiration on the woman for whom this illustrious man had for so many
years cherished feelings of reverential love.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Peace settles where the intellect is meek,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is a line which you will recall from one of the beautiful poems
Wordsworth has addressed to her; and this seemed peculiarly the temper
of her spirit&mdash;<i>peace</i>, the holy calmness of a heart to whom love had
been an 'unerring light.' Surely we may pray, my friend, that in the
brief season of separation which she has now to pass, she may be
strengthened with divine consolation.</p>

<p>I cannot forbear to quote here that beautiful passage, near the end of
the great poem, 'The Prelude,' as an utterance by the author of tender
feelings in his own matchless way. After speaking of his sister in tones
of deepest thankfulness, he adds,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i21">'Thereafter came<br /></span>
<span>One, whom with thee friendship had early prized;<br /></span>
<span>She came, no more a phantom to adorn<br /></span>
<span>A moment, but an inmate of the heart;<br /></span>
<span>And yet a spirit, there for me enshrined,<br /></span>
<span>To penetrate the lofty and the low;<br /></span>
<span>Even as one essence of pervading light<br /></span>
<span>Shines in the brightness of ten thousand stars,<br /></span>
<span>And the meek worm that feeds her lonely lamp<br /></span>
<span>Couched in the dewy grass.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I have been led away from my narrative; but I wished to record the
feelings which had arisen within me with regard to this excellent lady;
she who has been, as &mdash;&mdash; has so happily expressed it in his letter to
you, 'almost like the Poet's guardian angel for near fifty years.'</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I may here mention, that throughout the conversation Wordsworth's manner
was animated, and that he took pleasure in it evidently. His words were
very choice: each sentence seemed faultless. No one could have listened
to his talk for five minutes, even on ordinary topics, without
perceiving that he was a remarkable man. Not that he was brilliant; but
there was sustained vigour, and that mode of expression which denotes
habitual thoughtfulness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page481" id="page481"></a>{481}</span></p>

<p>When the clock struck four, I thought it time for me to go. Wordsworth
told me to say to his friends in America, that he and his wife were
well; that they had had a great grief of late, in the loss of their only
daughter, which he supposed they would never get over. This explained,
as I have already mentioned, the sadness of his manner. Such strength of
the affections in old age we rarely see. And yet the Poet has himself
condemned, as you remember, in 'The Excursion,' long and persevering
grief for objects of our love 'removed from this unstable world,'
reminding one so sorrowing of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">'that state<br /></span>
<span>Of pure, imperishable blessedness<br /></span>
<span>Which reason promises, and Holy Writ<br /></span>
<span>Ensures to all believers.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, as if foreseeing his own case, he has added, with touching power,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'And if there be whose tender frames have drooped<br /></span>
<span>Even to the dust, apparently through weight<br /></span>
<span>Of anguish unrelieved, and lack of power<br /></span>
<span>An agonising sorrow to transmute;<br /></span>
<span>Deem not that proof is here of hope withheld<br /></span>
<span>When wanted most; a confidence impaired<br /></span>
<span>So pitiably, that having ceased to see<br /></span>
<span>With bodily eyes, they are borne down by love<br /></span>
<span>Of what is lost, and perish through regret.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The weakness of his bodily frame it was which took away his power of
tranquil endurance. Bowed down by the weight of years, he had not
strength to sustain this further burden, grief for a much-loved child.
His mind, happily, retained its clearness, though his body was decaying.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He walked out into the entry with me, and then asked me to go again into
the dining-room, to look at an oak chest or cabinet he had there&mdash;a
piece of old furniture curiously carved. It bore a Latin inscription,
which stated that it was made 300 years ago, for William Wordsworth, who
was the son of, &amp;c. &amp;c. giving the ancestors of said William for many
generations, and ending, 'on whose souls may God have mercy.' This
Wordsworth repeated twice, and in an emphatic way, as he read the
inscription. It seemed to me that he took comfort in the religious
spirit of his ancestors, and that he was also adopting the solemn
ejaculation for himself. There was something very impressive in his
manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page482" id="page482"></a>{482}</span></p>

<p>I asked to see the cast from Chantrey's bust of him, which he at once
showed me; also a crayon sketch by Haydon, which, I understood him to
say, West had pronounced the finest crayon he had ever seen. He referred
also to another sketch, by Margaret Gillies, I think, which was there.</p>

<p>We then went out together on the lawn, and stood for a while to enjoy
the views, and he pulled open the shrubbery or hedge in places, that I
might see to better advantage. He accompanied me to the gate, and then
said if I had a few minutes longer to spare he would like to show me the
waterfall which was close by&mdash;the lower fall of Rydal. I gladly
assented, and he led the way across the grounds of Lady Fleming, which
were opposite to his own, to a small summer-house. The moment we opened
the door, the waterfall was before us; the summer-house being so placed
as to occupy the exact spot from which it was to be seen; the rocks and
shrubbery around closing it in on every side. The effect was magical.
The view from the rustic house, the rocky basin into which the water
fell, and the deep shade in which the whole was enveloped, made it a
lovely scene. Wordsworth seemed to have much pleasure in exhibiting this
beautiful retreat; it is described in one of his earlier poems, 'The
Evening Walk.'</p>

<p>As we returned together he walked very slowly, occasionally stopping
when he said anything of importance; and again I noticed that looking
into remote space of which I have already spoken. His eyes, though not
glistening, had yet in them the fire which betokened the greatness of
his genius. This no painter could represent, and this it was which gave
to his countenance its high intellectual expression.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Hartley Coleridge he spoke of with affection.... 'There is a single
line,' he added, 'in one of his father's poems which I consider explains
the after-life of the son. He is speaking of his own confinement in
London, and then says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"But thou, my child, shalt wander like a breeze."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Of Southey he said that he had had the misfortune to outlive his
faculties. His mind, he thought, had been weakened by long watching by
the sick-bed of his wife, who had lingered for years in a very
distressing state.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page483" id="page483"></a>{483}</span></p>

<p>The last subject he touched on was the international copyright
question&mdash;the absence of protection in our country to the works of
foreign authors. He said, mildly, that he thought it would be better
<i>for us</i> if some acknowledgment, however small, was made. The fame of
his own writings, as far as it was of pecuniary advantage to him, he had
long regarded with indifference; happily, he had an income more than
sufficient for all his wants.... He remarked, he had once seen a volume
of his poems published in an American newspaper.</p>

<p>I happened to have in my pocket the small volume of selections, which
you made some years ago. I produced it, and asked at the same time if he
had ever seen it. He replied he had not. He took it with evident
interest, turned to the title-page, which he read, with its motto. He
began the preface then, in the same way. But here I must record a
trifling incident, which may yet be worth noting. We were standing
together in the road, Wordsworth reading aloud, as I have said, when a
man accosted us asking charity&mdash;a beggar of the better class.
Wordsworth, scarcely looking off the book, thrust his hands into his
pockets, as if instinctively acknowledging the man's right to beg by
this prompt action. He seemed to find nothing, however; and he said, in
a sort of soliloquy, 'I have given to four or five, already, to-day,' as
if to account for his being then unprovided.</p>

<p>Wordsworth, as he turned over one leaf after another, said, 'But I shall
weary you, sir.' 'By no means,' said I; for I could have been content to
stand there for hours to hear, as I did, the Poet read from time to
time, with fitting emphasis, the choice passages which your preface and
biographical sketch contain. Imagine with what delight I listened to the
venerable man, and to hear, too, from his own lips, such words as these,
your own most true reflection: '<i>His has been a life devoted to the
cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses&mdash;a
self-dedication as complete as the world has ever witnessed</i>.' Your
remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries
among the poets, he read with affecting simplicity; his manner being
that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity,
and forward with sure hope. I felt that his honoured life was drawing
rapidly to a close, and with him there was evidently the same
consciousness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page484" id="page484"></a>{484}</span></p>

<p>He made but little comment on your notice of him. Occasionally he would
say, as he came to a particular fact, 'That's quite correct;' or, after
reading a quotation from his own works, he would add, 'That's from my
writings.' These quotations he read in a way that much impressed me; it
seemed almost as if he was awed by the greatness of his own power, the
gifts with which he had been endowed. It was a solemn time to me, this
part of my interview; and to you, my friend, it would have been a
crowning happiness to stand, as I did, by his side on that bright summer
day, and thus listen to his voice. I thought of his long life; that he
was one who had felt himself from early youth 'a renovated spirit
singled out for holy services'&mdash;one who had listened to the teachings of
Nature, and communed with his own heart in the seclusion of those
beautiful vales, until his thoughts were ready to be uttered for the
good of his fellow-men. And there had come back to him offerings of
love, and gratitude, and reverent admiration, from a greater multitude
than had ever before paid their homage to a living writer; and these
acknowledgments have been for benefits so deep and lasting, that words
seem but a poor return. But I will not attempt to describe further the
feelings which were strongly present to me at that moment, when I seemed
most to realise in whose presence I stood.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He walked with me as far as the main road to Ambleside. As we passed the
little chapel built by Lady Fleming, which has been the occasion, as you
remember, of one of his poems, there were persons, tourists evidently,
talking with the sexton at the door. Their inquiries, I fancied, were
about Wordsworth, perhaps as to the hour of service the next day
(Sunday), with the hope of seeing him there. One of them caught sight of
the venerable man at the moment, and at once seemed to perceive who it
was, for she motioned to the others to look, and they watched him with
earnest gaze. I was struck with their looks of delighted admiration. He
stopped when we reached the main road, saying that his strength would
not allow him to walk further. Giving me his hand, he desired again to
be remembered to you and others in America, and wished me a safe return
to my friends, and so we parted. I went on my way, happy in the
recollection of this, to me, memorable interview. My mind was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page485" id="page485"></a>{485}</span> in a
tumult of excitement, for I felt that I had been in the familiar
presence of one of the noblest of our race; and this sense of
Wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole
interview. I may speak, too, of the strong perception of his moral
elevation which I had at the same time. No word of unkindness had fallen
from him. He seemed to be living as if in the presence of God, by
habitual recollection. A strange feeling, almost of awe, had impressed
me while I was thus with him. Believing that his memory will be had in
honour in all coming time, I could not but be thankful that I had been
admitted to intimate intercourse with him then, when he was so near the
end of life. To you, my dear friend, I must again say I owe this
happiness, and to you it has been denied. You also, of all others of our
countrymen, would have most valued such an interview, for to you the
great Poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private
correspondence. No other American has he honoured in the same degree;
and by no one else in this country has the knowledge and appreciation of
his poetry been so much extended. The love which has so long animated
you has been such, that multitudes have been influenced to seek for joy
and refreshment from the same pure source.</p>

<p>I have been led, as I said at the beginning of my letter, to make this
record, partly from your suggestion, and partly from a remark of Southey
which I have lately seen, to the effect that Wordsworth was one of whom
posterity would desire to know all that can be remembered. You will not,
I trust, deem the incidents I have set down trivial; or consider any
detail too minute, the object of which was only to bring the living man
before you. Now that he has gone for ever from our sight in this world,
I am led to look back to the interview with a deeper satisfaction; and
it may be that this full account of it will have value hereafter. To you
it was due that I should make the record; by myself these remembrances
will ever be cherished among my choicest possessions.</p>

<p>Believe me, my dear friend, yours faithfully,</p>

<h3><a name="FPART_I" id="FPART_I"></a>(j) RECOLLECTIONS OF WORDSWORTH.</h3>

<div class="center">By Aubrey de Vere, Esq.<br />
<i>(Sent to the present Editor, and now first published)</i></div>


<h4>PART I.</h4>

<p>It was about eight years before his death that I had the happiness of
making acquaintance with Wordsworth. During the next four years I saw a
good deal of him, chiefly among his own mountains, and, besides many
delightful walks with him, I had the great honour of passing some days
under his roof. The strongest of my impressions respecting him was that
made by the manly simplicity, and lofty rectitude, which characterised
him. In one of his later sonnets he writes of himself thus: 'As a true
man who long had served the lyre:'&mdash;it was because he was a <i>true</i> man
that he was a true poet; and it was impossible to know him without being
reminded of this. In any case he must have been recognised as a man of
original and energetic genius; but it was his strong and truthful moral
nature, his intellectual sincerity, the abiding conscientiousness of his
imagination, which enabled that genius to do its great work, and
bequeath to the England of the future the most solid mass of
deep-hearted and authentic poetry which has been the gift to her of any
poet since the Elizabethan age. There was in his nature a veracity,
which, had it not been combined with an idealising imagination not less
remarkable, would to many have appeared prosaic; yet, had he not
possessed that characteristic, the products of his imagination would
have lacked reality. They might still have enunciated a deep and sound
philosophy; but they would have been divested of that human interest
which belongs to them in a yet higher degree. All the little incidents
of the neighbourhood were to him important.</p>

<p>The veracity and the ideality which are so signally combined in
Wordsworth's poetic descriptions of Nature, made themselves at least as
much felt whenever Nature was the theme of his discourse. In his intense
reverence for Nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with
an exacting severity; and if the descriptions were not true, and true in
a twofold sense, the more skilfully executed they were, the more was his
indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit. An untrue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page487" id="page487"></a>{487}</span>description of Nature was to him a profaneness, a heavenly message
sophisticated and falsely delivered. He expatiated much to me one day,
as we walked among the hills above Grasmere, on the mode in which Nature
had been described by one of the most justly popular of England's modern
poets&mdash;one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect. 'He
took pains,' Wordsworth said; 'he went out with his pencil and
note-book, and jotted down whatever struck him most&mdash;a river rippling
over the sands, a ruined tower on a rock above it, a promontory, and a
mountain ash waving its red berries. He went home, and wove the whole
together into a poetical description.' After a pause, Wordsworth resumed
with a flashing eye and impassioned voice, 'But Nature does not permit
an inventory to be made of her charms! He should have left his pencil
and note-book at home; fixed his eye, as he walked, with a reverent
attention on all that surrounded him, and taken all into a heart that
could understand and enjoy. Then, after several days had passed by, he
should have interrogated his memory as to the scene. He would have
discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him,
much was also most wisely obliterated. That which remained&mdash;the picture
surviving in his mind&mdash;would have presented the ideal and essential
truth of the scene, and done so, in a large part, by discarding much
which, though in itself striking, was not characteristic. In every scene
many of the most brilliant details are but accidental. A true eye for
Nature does not note them, or at least does not dwell on them.' On the
same occasion he remarked, 'Scott misquoted in one of his novels my
lines on <i>Yarrow</i>. He makes me write,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"The swans on sweet St. Mary's lake<br /></span>
<span>Float double, swans and shadow;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but I wrote</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"The <i>swan</i> on <i>still</i> St. Mary's lake."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Never could I have written "swans" in the plural. The scene when I saw
it, with its still and dim lake, under the dusky hills, was one of utter
loneliness: there was <i>one</i> swan, and one only, stemming the water, and
the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one
companion of that swan, its own white image in the water. It was for
that reason that I recorded the Swan and the Shadow. Had there been many
swans and many shadows, they would have implied nothing as regards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page488" id="page488"></a>{488}</span>character of the scene; and I should have said nothing about them.' He
proceeded to remark that many who could descant with eloquence on Nature
cared little for her, and that many more who truly loved her had yet no
eye to discern her&mdash;which he regarded as a sort of 'spiritual
discernment.' He continued, 'Indeed I have hardly ever known any one but
myself who had a true eye for Nature, one that thoroughly understood her
meanings and her teachings&mdash;except' (here he interrupted himself) 'one
person. There was a young clergyman, called Frederick Faber,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> who
resided at Ambleside. He had not only as good an eye for Nature as I
have, but even a better one, and sometimes pointed out to me on the
mountains effects which, with all my great experience, I had never
detected.'</p>

<p>Truth, he used to say&mdash;that is, truth in its largest sense, as a thing
at once real and ideal, a truth including exact and accurate detail, and
yet everywhere subordinating mere detail to the spirit of the
whole&mdash;this, he affirmed, was the soul and essence not only of
descriptive poetry, but of all poetry. He had often, he told me,
intended to write an essay on poetry, setting forth this principle, and
illustrating it by references to the chief representatives of poetry in
its various departments. It was this twofold truth which made Shakspeare
the greatest of all poets. 'It was well for Shakspeare,' he remarked,
'that he gave himself to the drama. It was that which forced him to be
sufficiently human. His poems would otherwise, from the extraordinarily
metaphysical character of his genius, have been too recondite to be
understood. His youthful poems, in spite of their unfortunate and
unworthy subjects, and his sonnets also, reveal this tendency. Nothing
can surpass the greatness of Shakspeare where he is at his greatest; but
it is wrong to speak of him as if even he were perfect. He had serious
defects, and not those only proceeding from carelessness. For instance,
in his delineations of character he does not assign as large a place to
religious sentiment as enters into the constitution of human nature
under normal circumstances. If his dramas had more religion in them,
they would be truer representations of man, as well as more elevated,
and of a more searching interest.' Wordsworth used to warn young poets
against writing poetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="page489" id="page489"></a>{489}</span> remote from human interest. Dante he admitted to
be an exception; but he considered that Shelley, and almost all others
who had endeavoured to out-soar the humanities, had suffered deplorably
from the attempt. I once heard him say, 'I have often been asked for
advice by young poets. All the advice I can give may be expressed in two
counsels. First, let Nature be your habitual and pleasurable study,
human nature and material nature; secondly, study carefully those
first-class poets whose fame is universal, not local, and learn from
them: learn from them especially how to observe and how to interpret
Nature.'</p>

<p>Those who knew Wordsworth only from his poetry might have supposed that
he dwelt ever in a region too serene to admit of human agitations. This
was not the fact. There was in his being a region of tumult as well as a
higher region of calm, though it was almost wholly in the latter that
his poetry lived. It turned aside from mere <i>personal</i> excitements; and
for that reason, doubtless, it developed more deeply those special
ardours which belong at once to the higher imagination and to the moral
being. The passion which was suppressed elsewhere burned in his 'Sonnets
to Liberty,' and added a deeper sadness to the 'Yew-trees of
Borrowdale.' But his heart, as well as his imagination, was ardent. When
it spoke most powerfully in his poetry it spoke with a stern brevity
unusual in that poetry, as in the poem 'There is a change and I am
poor,' and the still more remarkable one, 'A slumber did my spirit
seal,' a poem impassioned beyond the comprehension of those who fancy
that Wordsworth lacks passion, merely because in him passion is neither
declamatory nor, latently, sensual. He was a man of strong affections,
strong enough on one sorrowful occasion to withdraw him for a time from
poetry.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>Referring once to two young children of his who had died about forty
years previously, he described the details of their illnesses with an
exactness and an impetuosity of troubled excitement, such as might have
been expected if the bereavement had taken place but a few weeks before.
The lapse of time appeared to have left the sorrow submerged indeed, but
still in all its first freshness. Yet I afterwards heard that at the
time of the illness, at least in the case of one of the two children, it
was impossible to rouse his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page490" id="page490"></a>{490}</span>attention to the danger. He chanced to be
then under the immediate spell of one of those fits of poetic
inspiration which descended on him like a cloud. Till the cloud had
drifted he could see nothing beyond. Under the level of the calm there
was, however, the precinct of the storm. It expressed itself rarely but
vehemently, partaking sometimes of the character both of indignation and
sorrow. All at once the trouble would pass away, and his countenance
bask in its habitual calm, like a cloudless summer sky. His indignation
flamed out vehemently when he heard of a base action. 'I could kick such
a man across England with my naked foot,' I heard him exclaim on such an
occasion. The more impassioned part of his nature connected itself
especially with his political feelings. He regarded his own intellect as
one which united some of the faculties which belong to the statesman
with those which belong to the poet; and public affairs interested him
not less deeply than poetry. It was as patriot, not poet, that he
ventured to claim fellowship with Dante.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> He did not accept the term
'Reformer,' because it implied an organic change in our institutions,
and this he deemed both needless and dangerous; but he used to say that
while he was a decided Conservative, he remembered that to preserve our
institutions we must be ever improving them. He was, indeed, from first
to last, pre&euml;minently a patriot, an impassioned as well as a thoughtful
one. Yet his political sympathies were not with his own country only,
but with the progress of Humanity. Till disenchanted by the excesses and
follies of the first French revolution, his hopes and sympathies
associated themselves ardently with the new order of things created by
it; and I have heard him say that he did not know how any
generous-minded <i>young</i> man, entering on life at the time of that great
uprising, could have escaped the illusion. To the end his sympathies
were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace. If he
became a strong supporter of what has been called 'the hierarchy of
society,' it was chiefly because he believed the principle of 'equality'
to be fatal to the well-being and the true dignity of the poor.
Moreover, in siding politically with the Crown and the coronets, he
considered himself to be siding with the weaker party in our democratic
days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page491" id="page491"></a>{491}</span></p>

<p>The absence of love-poetry in Wordsworth's works has often been
remarked upon, and indeed brought as a charge against them. He once told
me that if he had avoided that form of composition, it was by no means
because the theme did not interest him, but because, treated as it
commonly has been, it tends rather to disturb and lower the reader's
moral and imaginative being than to elevate it. He feared to handle it
amiss. He seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised,
that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily,
especially as the theme, when treated unworthily, was such an easy and
cheap way of winning applause. It has been observed also that the
Religion of Wordsworth's poetry, at least of his earlier poetry, is not
as distinctly 'Revealed Religion' as might have been expected from this
poet's well-known adherence to what he has called emphatically 'The
lord, and mighty paramount of Truths.' He once remarked to me himself on
this circumstance, and explained it by stating that when in youth his
imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow,
his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they
had become on more mature thought, and that when his poetic mind and
manner had once been formed, he feared that he might, in attempting to
modify them, have become constrained. He added that on such matters he
ever wrote with great diffidence, remembering that if there were many
subjects too low for song, there were some too high. Wordsworth's
general confidence in his own powers, which was strong, though far from
exaggerated, rendered more striking and more touching his humility in
all that concerned Religion. It used to remind me of what I once heard
Mr. Rogers say, viz. 'There is a special character of <i>greatness</i> about
humility for it implies that a man can, in an unusual degree, estimate
the <i>greatness</i> of what is above us.' Fortunately his diffidence did not
keep Wordsworth silent on sacred themes; his later poems include an
unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of Christian faith; and one
of them, 'The Primrose of the Rock,' is as distinctly Wordsworthian in
its inspiration as it is Christian in its doctrine. Wordsworth was a
'high churchman,' and also, in his prose mind, strongly anti-Roman
Catholic, partly on political grounds; but that it was otherwise as
regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his Christian
poetry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page492" id="page492"></a>{492}</span> especially those which refer to the monastic system, and the
Schoolmen, and his sonnet on the Blessed Virgin, whom he addresses as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Our tainted nature's solitary boast.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He used to say that the idea of one who was both Virgin and Mother had
sunk so deep into the heart of Humanity, that there it must ever remain.</p>

<p>Wordsworth's estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high. I
remember his once saying to me, 'I have known many that might he called
very <i>clever</i> men, and a good many of real and vigorous <i>abilities</i>, but
few of genius; and only one whom I should call "wonderful." That one was
Coleridge. At any hour of the day or night he would talk by the hour, if
there chanced to be <i>any</i> sympathetic listener, and talk better than the
best page of his writings; for a pen half paralysed his genius. A child
would sit quietly at his feet and wonder, till the torrent had passed
by. The only man like Coleridge whom I have known is Sir William
Hamilton, Astronomer Royal of Dublin.' I remember, however, that when I
recited by his fireside Alfred Tennyson's two political poems, 'You ask
me why, though ill at ease,' and 'Of old sat Freedom on the heights,'
the old bard listened with a deepening attention, and when I had ended,
said after a pause, 'I must acknowledge that those two poems are very
solid and noble in thought. Their diction also seems singularly
stately.' He was a great admirer of <i>Philip van Artevelde</i>. In the case
of a certain poet since dead, and never popular, he said to me, 'I
consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times;' adding, 'Of course
I am not including my own in any comparison with those of others.' He
was not sanguine as to the future of English poetry. He thought that
there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature,
and especially he desired a really great History of England; but he was
disposed to regard the roll of English poetry as made up, and as leaving
place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or
imitational.</p>

<p>In his younger days Wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in
poetry, for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were
antagonistic to the maxims then current. It was fortunate for posterity,
no doubt, that his long 'militant estate'<span class="pagenum"><a name="page493" id="page493"></a>{493}</span> was animated by some mingling
of personal ambition with his love of poetry. Speaking in an early
sonnet of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'The poets, who on earth have made us heirs<br /></span>
<span>Of truth, and pure delight, by heavenly lays,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he concludes,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Oh! might my name be numbered among theirs,<br /></span>
<span>Then gladly would I end my mortal days.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He died at eighty, and general fame did not come to him till about
fifteen years before his death. This perhaps might have been fifteen
years too soon, if he had set any inordinate value on it. But it was not
so. Shelley tells us that' Fame is love disguised;' and it was
intellectual sympathy that Wordsworth had always valued far more than
reputation. 'Give me thy love; I claim no other fee,' had been his
demand on his reader. When Fame had laid her tardy garland at his feet
he found on it no fresher green than his 'Rydalian laurels' had always
worn. Once he said to me, 'It is indeed a deep satisfaction to hope and
believe that my poetry will be, while it lasts, a help to the cause of
virtue and truth&mdash;especially among the young. As for myself, it seems
now of little moment how long I may be remembered. When a man pushes off
in his little boat into the great seas of Infinity and Eternity, it
surely signifies little how long he is kept in sight by watchers from
the shore.'</p>

<p>Such are my chief recollections of the great poet, whom I knew but in
his old age, but whose heart retained its youth till his daughter Dora's
death. He seemed to me one who from boyhood had been faithful to a high
vocation; one who had esteemed it his office to minister, in an age of
conventional civilisation, at Nature's altar, and who had in his later
life explained and vindicated such life-long ministration, even while he
seemed to apologise for it, in the memorable confession,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'But who is innocent? By grace divine,<br /></span>
<span>Not otherwise, O Nature, are we thine.'<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was to Nature as first created, not to Nature as corrupted by
'disnatured' passions, that his song had attributed such high and
healing powers. In singing her praise he had chosen a theme loftier than
most of his readers knew&mdash;loftier, as he perhaps eventually discovered,
than he had at first supposed it to be. Utterly without Shakspeare's
dramatic faculty, he was richer<span class="pagenum"><a name="page494" id="page494"></a>{494}</span> and wider in the humanities than any
poet since Shakspeare. Wholly unlike Milton in character and in
opinions, he abounds in passages to be paralleled only by Milton in
solemn and spiritual sublimity, and not even by Milton in pathos. It was
plain to those who knew Wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure,
and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had
been bestowed. He had ever written with a conscientious reverence for
that gift; but he had also written spontaneously. He had composed with
care&mdash;not the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity, and
which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences; but the diligence
which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a
poem's meaning, and frustrate its purpose. He regarded poetry as an art;
but he also regarded Art not as the compeer of Nature, much less her
superior, but as her servant and interpreter. He wrote poetry likewise,
no doubt, in a large measure, because self-utterance was an essential
law of his nature. If he had a companion, he discoursed like one whose
thoughts must needs run on in audible current; if he walked alone among
his mountains, he murmured old songs. He was like a pine grove, vocal as
well as visible. But to poetry he had dedicated himself as to the
utterance of the highest truths brought within the range of his life's
experience; and if his poetry has been accused of egotism, the charge
has come from those who did not perceive that it was with a human, not a
mere personal interest that he habitually watched the processes of his
own mind. He drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he
hoped might be a refreshment to those far off. He once said, speaking of
a departed man of genius, who had lived an unhappy life and deplorably
abused his powers, to the lasting calamity of his country, 'A great poet
must be a great man; and a great man must be a good man; and a good man
ought to be a happy man.' To know Wordsworth was to feel sure that if he
had been a great poet, it was not merely because he had been endowed
with a great imagination, but because he had been a good man, a great
man, and a man whose poetry had, in an especial sense, been the
expression of a healthily happy moral being.</p>

<p>P.S. Wordsworth was by no means without humour. When the Queen on one
occasion gave a masked ball, some one said that a certain youthful poet,
who has since reached a deservedly high place both in the literary and
political world, but who was then known chiefly as an accomplished and
amusing young man of society, was to attend it dressed in the character

<p>SONNET&mdash;RYDAL WITH WORDSWORTH.</p>

<p>BY THE LATE SIR AUBREY DE VERE.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'What we beheld scarce can I now recall<br /></span>
<span>In one connected picture; images<br /></span>
<span>Hurrying so swiftly their fresh witcheries<br /></span>
<span>O'er the mind's mirror, that the several<br /></span>
<span>Seems lost, or blended in the mighty all.<br /></span>
<span>Lone lakes; rills gushing through rock-rooted trees:<br /></span>
<span>Peaked mountains shadowing vales of peacefulness:<br /></span>
<span>Glens echoing to the flashing waterfall.<br /></span>
<span>Then that sweet twilight isle! with friends delayed<br /></span>
<span>Beside a ferny bank 'neath oaks and yews;<br /></span>
<span>The moon between two mountain peaks embayed;<br /></span>
<span>Heaven and the waters dyed with sunset hues:<br /></span>
<span>And he, the Poet of the age and land,<br /></span>
<span>Discoursing as we wandered hand in hand.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The above-written sonnet is the record of a delightful day spent by my
father in 1833 with Wordsworth at Rydal, to which he went from the still
more beautiful shores of Ulswater, where he had been sojourning at
Halsteads. He had been one of Wordsworth's warmest admirers, when their
number was small, and in 1842 he dedicated a volume of poems to
him.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> He taught me when a boy of 18 years old to admire the great
bard. I had been very enthusiastically praising Lord Byron's poetry. My
father calmly replied, 'Wordsworth is the great poet of modern times.'
Much surprised, I asked, 'And what may his special merits be?' The
answer was, 'They are very various, as for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page496" id="page496"></a>{496}</span> instance, depth, largeness,
elevation, and, what is rare in modern poetry, an <i>entire</i> purity. In
his noble "Laodamia" they are chiefly majesty and pathos.' A few weeks
afterwards I chanced to take from the library shelves a volume of
Wordsworth, and it opened on 'Laodamia.' Some strong, calm hand seemed
to have been laid on my head, and bound me to the spot, till I had come
to the end. As I read, a new world, hitherto unimagined, opened itself
out, stretching far away into serene infinitudes. The region was one to
me unknown, but the harmony of the picture attested its reality. Above
and around were indeed</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'An ampler ether, a diviner air,<br /></span>
<span>And fields invested with purpureal gleams;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and when I reached the line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Calm pleasures there abide&mdash;majestic pains,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I felt that no tenants less stately could walk in so lordly a precinct.
I had been translated into another planet of song&mdash;one with larger
movements and a longer year. A wider conception of poetry had become
mine, and the Byronian enthusiasm fell from me like a bond that is
broken by being outgrown. The incident illustrates poetry in one of its
many characters, that of 'the deliverer.' The ready sympathies and
inexperienced imagination of youth make it surrender itself easily
despite its better aspirations, or in consequence of them, to a false
greatness; and the true greatness, once revealed, sets it free. As early
as 1824 Walter Savage Landor, in his 'Imaginary Conversation' between
Southey and Porson, had pronounced Wordsworth's 'Laodamia' to be 'a
composition such as Sophocles might have exulted to own, and a part of
which might have been heard with shouts of rapture in the regions he
describes'&mdash;the Elysian Fields.</p>

<p>Wordsworth frequently spoke of death, as if it were the taking of a new
degree in the University of Life. 'I should like,' he remarked to a
young lady, 'to visit Italy again before I move to another planet.' He
sometimes made a mistake in assuming that others were equally
philosophical. We were once breakfasting at the house of Mr. Rogers,
when Wordsworth, after gazing attentively round the room with a
benignant and complacent expression, turned to our host, and wishing to
compliment him, said, 'Mr. Rogers, I never see this house, so perfect in
its taste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page497" id="page497"></a>{497}</span> so exquisite in all its arrangements, and decorated with
such well-chosen pictures, without fancying it the very house imaged to
himself by the Roman poet, when, in illustration of man's mortality, he
says, "Linquenda est domus."' 'What is that you are saying?' replied Mr.
Rogers, whose years, between eighty and ninety, had not improved his
hearing. 'I was remarking that your house,' replied Wordsworth, 'always
reminds me of the Ode (more properly called an Elegy, though doubtless
the lyrical measure not unnaturally causes it to be included among
Horace's Odes) in which the Roman poet writes "Linquenda est domus;"
that is, since, ladies being present, a translation may be deemed
desirable, <i>The house is</i>, or <i>has to be, left</i>; and again, "et placens
uxor"&mdash;and the pleasing wife; though, as we must all regret, that part
of the quotation is not applicable on the present occasion.' The Town
Bard, on whom 'no angle smiled' more than the end of St. James's-place,
did not enter into the views of the Bard of the Mountains. His answer
was what children call 'making a great face,' and the ejaculation,
'Don't talk Latin in, the society of ladies.' When I was going away he
remarked, 'What a stimulus the mountain air has on the appetite! I made
a sign to Edmund to hand him the cutlets a second time. I was afraid he
would stick his fork into that beautiful woman who sat next him.'
Wordsworth never resented a jest at his own expense. Once when we had
knocked three times in vain at the door of a London house, I exclaimed,
quoting his sonnet written on Westminster-bridge,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Dear God, the very houses seem asleep.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He laughed heartily, then smiled gravely, and lastly recounted the
occasion, and described the early morning on which that sonnet was
written. He did not recite more than a part of it, to the accompaniment
of distant cab and carriage; and I thought that the door was opened too
soon.</p>

<p>Wordsworth, despite his dislike to great cities, was attracted
occasionally in his later years</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'To the proud margin of the Thames,<br /></span>
<span>And Lambeth's venerable towers,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>where his society was courted by persons of the most different
character. But he complained bitterly of the great city. It was next to
impossible, he remarked, to tell the truth in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page498" id="page498"></a>{498}</span> 'Yesterday I was at
S. House: the Duchess of S., showing me the pictures, observed, "This is
the portrait of my brother" (naming him), "and it is considered very
like." To this I assented, partly perhaps in absence of mind, but
partly, I think, with an impression that her Grace's brother was
probably a person whose face every one knew, or was expected to know; so
that, as I had never met him, my answer was in fact a lie! It is too bad
that, when more than seventy years old, I should be brought from the
mountains to London in order to tell a lie!' He made his complaint
wherever he went, laying the blame, however, not so much on himself, or
on the Duchess, as on the corrupt city; and some of those who learned
how the most truthful man in England had thus quickly been subverted by
metropolitan snares came to the conclusion that within a few years more
no virtue would be left extant in the land. He was likewise maltreated
in lesser ways. 'This morning I was compelled by my engagements to eat
three breakfasts&mdash;one with an aged and excellent gentleman, who may
justly be esteemed an accomplished man of letters, although I cannot
honestly concede to him the title of a poet; one at a fashionable party;
and one with an old friend whom no pressure would induce me to
neglect&mdash;although for this, my first breakfast to-day, I was obliged to
name the early hour of seven o'clock, as he lives in a remote part of
London.'</p>

<p>But it was only among his own mountains that Wordsworth could be
understood. He walked among them not so much to admire them as to
converse with them. They exchanged thoughts with him, in sunshine or
flying shadow, giving him their own and accepting his. Day and night, at
all hours, and in all weather, he would face them. If it rained, he
might fling his plaid over him, but would take no admonition. He must
have his way. On such occasions, dutiful as he was in higher matters, he
remained incurably wayward. In vain one reminded him that a letter
needed an answer, or that the storm would soon be over. It was very
necessary for him to do what he liked; and one of his dearest friends
said to me, with a smile of the most affectionate humour, 'He wrote his
"Ode to Duty," and then he had done with that matter.' This very
innocent form of lawlessness, corresponding with the classic expression,
'Indulge genio,' seemed to belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="page499" id="page499"></a>{499}</span> to his genius, not less than the
sympathetic reverence with which he looked up to the higher and
universal laws. Sometimes there was a battle between his reverence for
Nature and his reverence for other things. The friend already alluded to
was once remarking on his varying expressions of countenance. 'That
rough old face is capable of high and real beauty; I have seen in it an
expression quite of heavenly peace and contemplative delight, as the May
breeze came over him from the woods while he was slowly walking out of
church on a Sunday morning, and when he had half emerged from the
shadow.' A flippant person present inquired, 'Did you ever chance, Miss
F., to observe that heavenly expression on his countenance, as he was
walking into church, on a fine May morning?' A laugh was the reply. The
ways of Nature harmonised with his feelings in age as well as in youth.
He could understand no estrangement. Gathering a wreath of white thorn
on one occasion, he murmured, as he slipped it into the ribbon which
bound the golden tresses of his youthful companion,</p>

<h3><a name="SHELLEY" id="SHELLEY"></a>(<i>k</i>) FROM 'RECOLLECTIONS OF THE LAST DAYS OF SHELLEY AND BYRON.'</h3>

<div class="center">BY E.J. TRELAWNY. 1858 (MOXON).</div>

<p>Some days after this conversation I walked to Lausanne, to breakfast at
the hotel with an old friend, Captain Daniel Roberts, of the navy. He
was out sketching, but presently came in accompanied by two English
ladies, with whom he had made acquaintance whilst drawing, and whom he
brought to our hotel. The husband of one of them soon followed. I saw by
their utilitarian garb, as well as by the blisters and blotches on their
cheeks, lips, and noses, that they were pedestrian tourists, fresh from
the snow-covered mountains, the blazing sun and frosty air having acted
on their unseasoned skins as boiling water does on the lobster by dyeing
his dark coat scarlet. The man was evidently a denizen of the north, his
accent harsh, skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="page500" id="page500"></a>{500}</span> white, of an angular and bony build, and
self-confident and dogmatic in his opinions. The precision and
quaintness of his language, as well as his eccentric remarks on common
things, stimulated my mind. Our icy islanders thaw rapidly when they
have drifted into warmer latitudes: broken loose from its anti-social
system, mystic castes, coteries, sets, and sects, they lay aside their
purse-proud, tuft-hunting, and toadying ways, and are very apt to run
risk in the enjoyment of all their senses. Besides, we were compelled to
talk in strange company, if not from good breeding, to prove our breed,
as the gift of speech is often our principal, if not sole, distinction
from the rest of the brute animals.</p>

<p>To return to our breakfast. The travellers, flushed with health,
delighted with their excursion, and with appetites earned by bodily and
mental activity, were in such high spirits that Roberts and I caught the
infection of their mouth; we talked as loud and fast as if under the
exhilarating influence of champagne, instead of such a sedative compound
as <i>caf&eacute; au lait</i>. I can rescue nothing out of oblivion but a few last
words. The stranger expressed his disgust at the introduction of
carriages into the mountain districts of Switzerland, and at the old
fogies who used them.</p>

<p>'As to the arbitrary, pitiless, godless wretches,' he exclaimed, 'who
have removed Nature's landmarks by cutting roads through Alps and
Apennines, until all things are reduced to the same dead level, they
will he arraigned hereafter with the unjust: they have robbed the best
specimens of what men should be of their freeholds in the mountains; the
eagle, the black cock, and the red deer they have tamed or exterminated.
The lover of Nature can nowhere find a solitary nook to contemplate her
beauties. Yesterday,' he continued, 'at the break of day, I scaled the
most rugged height within my reach; it looked inaccessible; this
pleasant delusion was quickly dispelled; I was rudely startled out of a
deep reverie by the accursed jarring, jingling, and rumbling of a
cal&egrave;che, and harsh voices that drowned the torrent's fall.'</p>

<p>The stranger, now hearing a commotion in the street, sprang on his feet,
looked out of the window, and rang the bell violently.</p>

<p>'Waiter,' he said, 'is that our carriage? Why did you not tells us?
Come, lasses, be stirring; the freshness of the day is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page501" id="page501"></a>{501}</span> gone. You may
rejoice in not having to walk; there is a chance of saving the remnants
of skin the sun has left on our chins and noses; to-day we shall he
stewed instead of barbecued.'</p>

<p>On their leaving the room to get ready for their journey, my friend
Roberts told me the strangers were the poet Wordsworth, his wife and
sister.</p>

<p>Who could have divined this? I could see no trace, in the hard features
and weather-stained brow of the outer man, of the divinity within him.
In a few minutes the travellers reappeared; we cordially shook hands,
and agreed to meet again at Geneva. Now that I knew that I was talking
to one of the veterans of the gentle craft, as there was no time to
waste in idle ceremony, I asked him abruptly what he thought of Shelley
as a poet.</p>

<p>'Nothing,' he replied as abruptly.</p>

<p>Seeing my surprise, he added, 'A poet who has not produced a good poem
before he is twenty-five we may conclude cannot and never will do so.'</p>

<p>'The "Cenci"!' I said eagerly.</p>

<p>'Won't do,' he replied, shaking his head, as he got into the carriage: a
rough-coated Scotch terrier followed him.</p>

<p>'This hairy fellow is our flea-trap,' he shouted out as they started
off.</p>

<p>When I recovered from the shock of having heard the harsh sentence
passed by an elder bard on a younger brother of the Muses, I exclaimed,</p>

<p>'After all, poets are but earth. It is the old story,&mdash;envy&mdash;Cain and
Abel. Professions, sects, and communities in general, right or wrong,
hold together, men of the pen excepted; if one of their guild is worsted
in the battle, they do as the rooks do by their inky brothers&mdash;fly from
him, cawing and screaming; if they don't fire the shot, they sound the
bugle to charge.'</p>

<p>I did not then know that the full-fledged author never reads the
writings of his contemporaries, except to cut them up in a review, that
being a work of love. In after years, Shelley being dead, Wordsworth
confessed this fact; he was then induced to read some of Shelley's
poems, and admitted that Shelley was the greatest master of harmonious
verse in our modern literature. (Pp. 4-8.)<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>Rydal, where we now are, has an air of repose and seclusion which I have
rarely seen surpassed; the first few days we were here we perfectly
luxuriated in the purity and sweetness of the air and the delicious
stillness of its pastures and woods. It is interesting, too, on another
account, as being the residence of the poet Wordsworth: his house is
about a quarter of a mile from ours; and since Osler joined us we have
obtained an introduction to him, and he favoured us with his company at
tea one evening last week. He is a very interesting man, remarkably
simple in his manners, full of enthusiasm and eloquence in conversation,
especially on the subject of his favourite art&mdash;poetry&mdash;which he seems
to have studied in a very philosophical spirit, and about which he
entertains some peculiar opinions. Spenser, Shakspeare, and Milton are
his favourites among the English poets, especially the latter, whom he
almost idolises. He expressed one opinion which rather surprised me, and
in which I could not concur&mdash;that he preferred the 'Samson Agonistes' to
'Comus.' He recited in vindication of his judgment one very fine passage
from the former poem, and in a very striking manner; his voice is deep
and pathetic, and thrills with feeling. He is Toryish&mdash;at least what
would he considered so&mdash;in his political principles, though he disclaims
all connection with party, and certainly argues with great fairness and
temper on controverted topics, such as Parliamentary Reform and Catholic
Emancipation. We took a long walk with him the other evening, to the
scene of one of his Pastorals in the neighbourhood of Grasmere. He has a
good deal of general conversation, and has more the manners of a man of
the world than I should have expected from his poems; but his discourse
indicates great simplicity and purity of mind; indeed, nothing renders
his conversation more interesting than the unaffected tone of elevated
morality and devotion which pervades it. We have been reading his long
poem, the 'Excursion,' since we came here. I particularly recommend it
to your notice, barring some few <span class="pagenum"><a name="page503" id="page503"></a>{503}</span>extra vagancies into which his
peculiar theory has led him: his fourth book, the last, contains
specimens both of versification, sentiment, and imagery, scarcely
inferior to what you will find in the best passages of Milton. He spoke
with great plainness, and yet with candour, of his contemporaries. He
admitted the power of Byron in describing the workings of human passion,
but denied that he knew anything of the beauties of Nature, or succeeded
in describing them with fidelity. This he illustrated by examples. He
spoke with deserved severity of Byron's licentiousness and contempt of
religious decorum. He told us he thought the greatest of modern
geniuses, had he given his powers a proper direction, and one decidedly
superior to Byron, was Shelley, a young man, author of 'Queen Mab,' who
died lately at Rome. (Vol. i. pp. 72-4.)</p>

<p>....Though I am busy, I feel rather melancholy; and I am continually
reminded how sad my life would be without the society and affection of
those we love, and how terribly awful the dispensation of death must be
to those who cannot anticipate a future reunion, and regard it as the
utter extinction of all human interests and affections. I am solacing
myself with Wordsworth. Do you know, I shall become a thorough convert
to him. Much of his poetry is delicious, and I perfectly adore his
philosophy. To me he seems the purest, the most elevated, and the most
Christian of poets. I delight in his deep and tender piety, and his
spirit of exquisite sympathy with whatever is lovely and grand in the
breathing universe around us. (Vol. i. p. 86.)</p>

<h3><a name="CRABBE" id="CRABBE"></a>(<i>m</i>) ANECDOTE OF CRABBE.</h3>

<div class="center">FROM 'DIARY OF SIR WALTER SCOTT.'</div>

<p>Talking of Wordsworth, he [W.] told Anne a story, the object of which,
as she understood it, was to show that Crabbe had no imagination.
Crabbe, Sir George Beaumont, and Wordsworth were sitting together in
Murray's room in Albemarle-street. Sir George, after sealing a letter,
blew out the candle which had enabled him to do so, and exchanging a
look with Wordsworth, began to admire in silence the undulating thread
of smoke which slowly arose from the expiring wick, when Crabbe put on
the extinguisher. Anne laughed at the instance, and inquired if the
taper was wax; and being answered in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page504" id="page504"></a>{504}</span> negative, seemed to think that
there was no call on Mr. Crabbe to sacrifice his sense of smell to their
admiration of beautiful and evanescent forms. In two other men I should
have said, 'Why, it is affectations,' with Sir Hugh Evans ['Merry Wives
of Windsor,' act i. scene 1]; but Sir George is the man in the world
most void of affectation; and then he is an exquisite painter, and no
doubt saw where the <i>incident</i> would have succeeded in painting. The
error is not in you yourself receiving deep impressions from slight
hints, but in supposing that precisely the same sort of impression must
arise in the mind of men otherwise of kindred feeling, or that the
common-place folk of the world can derive such inductions at any time or
under any circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<h3><a name="BROUGHAM" id="BROUGHAM"></a>(<i>n</i>) LATER OPINION OF LOUD BROUGHAM.</h3>

<p>I am just come from breakfasting with Henry Taylor to meet Wordsworth;
the same party as when he had Southey&mdash;Mill, Elliot, Charles Villiers.
Wordsworth may be bordering on sixty; hard-featured, brown, wrinkled,
with prominent teeth and a few scattered gray hairs, but nevertheless
not a disagreeable countenance; and very cheerful, merry, courteous, and
talkative, much more so than I should have expected from the grave and
didactic character of his writings. He held forth on poetry, painting,
politics, and metaphysics, and with a great deal of eloquence; he is
more conversible and with a greater flow of animal spirits than Southey.
He mentioned that he never wrote down as he composed, but composed
walking, riding, or in bed, and wrote down after; that Southey always
composes at his desk. He talked a great deal of Brougham, whose talents
and domestic virtues he greatly admires; that he was very generous and
affectionate in his disposition, full of duty and attention to his
mother, and had adopted and provided for a whole family of his brother's
children, and treats his wife's children as if they were his own. He
insisted upon taking them both with him to the Drawing-room the other
day when he went in state as Chancellor. They remonstrated with him, but
in vain.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

seen. She was unique in her sweetness and goodness. I mean that her
character was most peculiar&mdash;a compound of vehemence of feeling and
gentleness, sharpness and lovingness, which is not often seen' ('Memoirs
and Letters of Sara Coleridge, edited by her Daughter,' 2 vols. 8vo, 3d
edition, 1873, p. 68). Later: 'I do confess that I have never been able
to rank "The Triad" among Mr. Wordsworth's immortal works of genius. It
is just what he came into the poetical world to condemn, and both by
practice and theory to supplant. It is to my mind <i>artificial</i> and
<i>unreal</i>. There is no truth in it as a whole, although bits of truth,
glazed and magnified, are embodied in it, as in the lines, "Features to
old ideal grace allied"&mdash;a most unintelligible<span class="pagenum"><a name="page506" id="page506"></a>{506}</span> allusion to a likeness
discovered in dear Dora's contour of countenance to the great Memnon
head in the British Museum, with its overflowing lips and width of
mouth, which seems to be typical of the ocean. The poem always strikes
me as a mongrel,' &amp;c. (p. 352).</p>

the Letters of Lamb are even at this later day either withheld or
sorrowfully mutilated; <i>e.g.</i> among the Wordsworth Correspondence
(unpublished) is a whole sheaf of letters in their finest vein from Lamb
and his sister. Some of the former are written in black and red ink in
alternate lines, and overflow with all his deepest and quaintest
characteristics. His sister's are charming. The same might be said of
nearly all Wordsworth's greatest contemporaries. Surely these MSS. will
not much longer be kept in this inexplicable and, I venture to say,
scarcely pardonable seclusion?</p>

<p><a href="#page192">P. 192</a>, foot-note. This deliciously <i>na&iuml;ve</i> note of 'Dora' to her
venerated father suggests that it is due similarly to demur&mdash;with all
respect&mdash;to the representation given of Mrs. Hemans (pp. 193-4). Three
things it must be permitted me to recall: (<i>a</i>) That the 'brevity's
sake' hardly condones the fulness of statement of an imagined ignorance
of 'housewifery' on the part of Mrs. Hemans. (<i>b</i>) That a visitor for a
few days in a family could scarcely be expected to set about using her
needle in home duties. (<i>c</i>) That unquestionable testimony, furnished me
by those who knew her intimately, warrant me to state that Wordsworth
was mistaken in supposing that Mrs. Hemans 'could as easily have managed
the spear of Minerva as her needle.' Her brave and beautiful life, and
her single-handed upbringing of her many boys worthily, make one deeply
regret that such sweeping generalisation from a narrow and hasty
observation should have been indulged in. My profound veneration for
Wordsworth does not warrant my suppression of the truth in this matter.
Be it remembered, too, that other expressions of Wordsworth largely
qualify the present ungracious judgment.</p>

<p><a href="#page449">P. 449</a>, l. 34 onward. Mrs. Wordsworth. My excellent Correspondent the
Rev. R.P. Graves, of Dublin, thus writes me of Mrs. Wordsworth: 'I
forget whether it has been put on record, as it certainly deserves to
be, that Wordsworth habitually referred to his wife for the help of her
judgment on his poems. Mrs. Wordsworth did not indeed possess the
creative and colouring power of imagination that belonged to his sister
as well as to himself; but her simple truthfulness, her strong good
sense (which no sophistry could impose upon), and her delicate feeling
for propriety, rendered her judgment a test of utmost value with regard
to any subjects of which it could take adequate cognisance. And these
were confined within no narrow range&mdash;the workings of Nature as it lived
and moved around her, social equities and charities, religious and moral
truth, tried by the heart as well as by the head, and verbal expression,
required by her to avoid the regions of the merely abstract and
philosophical, and keep to the lower but more poetical ground of
idiomatic strength and transparent logic.'</p>

<p><a href="#page457">P. 457</a>, l. 18. 'The (almost) contemporary notice of Milton.' A still
more significant contemporary notice of Milton than the well-known one
of the text occurs in 'The Censure of the Rota upon Mr. Milton's book
entituled The Ready and Easie Way to establish a Free Commonwealth,
1660, by James Harrington,' as comes out at p. 16 ('<i>my</i> Oceana'). As it
seems to have escaped the commentators, a short quotation must be given
here: 'Though you have scribled your eyes out, your works have never
been printed but for the company of Chandlers and Tobacco-Men, who are
your Stationers, and the onely men that vend your Labors' (pp. 4-5). 'He
[a member of the Rota] said that he himself reprieved the Whole <i>Defence
of the People of England</i> for a groat, that was sentenced to vile
<i>Mundungus</i>, and had suffer'd inevitably (but for him), though it cost
you much oyle and the Rump 300<i>l.</i> a year,' &amp;c. (ibid.). This of the
'Defence'!!!</p>

<p><a href="#page459">P. 459</a>, l. 7 onward. Horace, Ode iv. 2, 1; ibid. 2, 27.</p>

<p><a href="#page462">P. 462</a>, l. 15. 'Walter Scott is not a careful composer,' &amp;c. This recurs
in Mr. Aubrey do Vere's 'Recollections' (p. 487 onward). I venture as a
Scot to observe that for this one slight misquotation by Scott, on which
so large a conclusion is built, the quotations by Wordsworth from others
would furnish twenty-fold. He was singularly inexact in quotation, as
even these Notes and Illustrations will satisfy in the places&mdash;scarcely
in a single instance being verbally accurate. 'Sweet' certainly was a
perfectly fitting word for the sequestered lake of St. Mary in its
serene summer beauty. Moreover, swans are not usually found singly, but
in pairs; and a pair surely differenced not greatly the symbol of
loneliness. The latter remark points to Wordsworth's further objection,
as stated to Mr. de Vere (as <i>supra</i>).</p>

<p><a href="#page492">P. 492</a>, l. 26. 'In the case of a certain poet since dead,' &amp;c. I may
record what his own son has not felt free to do, that this was Sir
Aubrey de Vere, whose 'Song of Faith, and other Poems,' has not yet
gathered its ultimate renown. Wordsworth greatly admired the modest
little volume. See one of his Sonnets<span class="pagenum"><a name="page510" id="page510"></a>{510}</span> on page 495. Nor with the
Laureate's poem-play of 'Queen Mary' (Tudor) winning inevitable welcome
ought it to be forgotten&mdash;as even prominent critics of it are
sorrowfully forgetting&mdash;that Sir Aubrey de Vere, so long ago as 1847,
published <i>his</i> drama of 'Mary Tudor.' I venture to affirm that it takes
its place&mdash;a lofty one&mdash;beside 'Philip van Artevelde,' and that it need
fear no comparison with 'Queen Mary.' Early and comparatively modern
supreme poetry somehow gets out of sight for long.</p>

<p><a href="#page497">P. 497</a>, 1. 15. Read 'no angel smiled.' I can only offer the plea of an
old Worthy, who said, 'Errata are inevitable, for we are human; and to
have none would imply eyes behind as well as before, or the wallet of
our errors all in front.' G.</p>

following from the same source, earlier, may fitly find a place here:
'It was in the September of this year [1803] that Scott first saw
Wordsworth. Their common acquaintance, Stoddart, had so often talked of
them to each other, that they met as if they had not been strangers; and
they parted friends. Mr. and Miss Wordsworth had just completed that
tour in the Highlands of which so many incidents have since been
immortalised, both in the poet's sense and in the hardly less poetical
prose of his sister's Diary. On the morning of the 17th of September,
having left their carriage at Rosslyn, they walked down the valley to
Lasswade, and arrived there before Mr. and Mrs. Scott had risen. "We
were received," Mr. Wordsworth has told me, "with that frank cordiality
which, under whatever circumstances I afterwards met him, always marked
his manners; and, indeed, I found him then in every respect&mdash;except
perhaps that his animal spirits were somewhat higher&mdash;precisely the same
man that you knew him in later life; the same lively, entertaining
conversation, full of anecdote, and averse from disquisition; the same
unaffected modesty about himself; the same cheerful and benevolent and
hopeful views of man and the world. He partly read and partly recited,
sometimes in an enthusiastic style of chant, the first four cantos of
the "Lay of the Last Minstrel;" and the novelty of the manners, the
clear picturesque descriptions, and the easy glowing energy of much of
the verse, greatly delighted me."' (pp. 160-1).</p></div>

Messias,' says Mr. Carlyle, 'which elicits in our critic (Mr. Taylor) an
instinct truer than his philosophy is. Neither has the still purer
spirit of Klopstock's odes escaped him. Perhaps there is no writing in
our language that offers so correct an emblem of him as this analysis.'
I remember thinking Taylor's 'clear outline' of the Messias the most
satisfying account of a poem I ever read: it fills the mind with a
vision of pomp and magnificence, which it is pleasanter to contemplate,
as it were, from afar, massed together in that general survey, than to
examine part by part. Mr. Taylor and Mr. Carlyle agree in exalting that
ode of Klopstock's, in which he represents the Muse of Britain and the
Muse of Germany running a race. The piece seems to me more rhetorical
than strictly poetical; and if the younger Muse's power of keeping up
the race depends on productions of this sort, I would not give a penny
for her chance, at least if the contest relates to pure poetry.
Klopstock's <i>Herman</i> (mentioned afterwards,) consists of three
chorus-dramas, as Mr. Taylor calls them: <i>The Battle of Herman</i>, <i>Herman
and the Princes</i>, and <i>The Death of Herman</i>. Herman is the Arminius of
the Roman historians. S.C.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_226_226" id="Footnote_226_226"></a><a href="#FNanchor_226_226"><span class="label">[226]</span></a> <i>Leonidus</i>, an epic poem, by R. Glover, first appeared in
May, 1737: in the fifth edition, published in 1770, it was corrected and
extended from nine books to twelve. Glover was the author of Boadicea
and Medea, tragedies, which had some success on the stage. I believe
that <i>Leonidas</i> has more merit in the conduct of the design, and in the
delineation of character, than as poetry.
</p><p>
'He write an epic poem,' said Thomson, 'who never saw a mountain!'
Glover had seen the sun and moon, yet he seems to have looked for their
poetical aspects in Homer and Milton, rather than in the sky. 'There is
not a single simile in <i>Leonidas</i>,' says Lyttleton, 'that is borrowed
from any of the ancients, and yet there is hardly any poem that has such
a variety of beautiful comparisons.' The similes of Milton come so flat
and dry out of Glover's mangle, that they are indeed quite <i>another
thing</i> from what they appear in the poems of that Immortal: <i>ex. gr.</i>
</p>

<span>And o'er the raven plumes of darkness shed<br /></span>
<span>Her placid light.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is flattened from the well-known passage in Comus.</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">Soon will savage Mars<br /></span>
<span>Deform the lovely <i>ringlets of thy shrubs</i>.<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>Thus does this poet shatter and dissolve the blooming sprays of another
man's plantation, instead of pushing through them some new shoots of his
own to crown them with fresh blossoms.
</p>

<p>Milton himself borrowed as much as Glover. Aye, ten times more; yet
every passage in his poetry is Miltonic,&mdash;more than anything else. On
the other hand, his imitators <i>Miltonize</i>, yet produce nothing worthy of
Milton, the important characteristic of whose writings my father well
expressed, when he said 'The reader of Milton must be always on his
duty: <i>he is surrounded with sense</i>.' A man must have his sense to
imitate him worthily. How we look through his words at the Deluge, as he
floods it upon us in Book xi. l. 738-53!&mdash;The Attic bees produce honey
so flavoured with the thyme of Hymettus that it is scarcely eatable,
though to smell the herb itself in a breezy walk upon that celebrated
Mount would be an exceeding pleasure; thus certain epic poems are
overpoweringly flavoured with herbs of Milton, while yet the fragrant
balm and fresh breeze of his poetry is not to be found in them. S.C.</p></div>

appears at the very commencement of <i>Leonidas</i>, which has something
military in its movement, but rather the stiff gait of the drilled
soldier than the proud march of the martial hero.

gentleman at Helmstadt, who had been Klopstock's school and bed-fellow.
Among other boyish anecdotes, he related that the young poet set a
particular value on a translation of the PARADISE LOST, and always slept
with it under his pillow.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_229_229" id="Footnote_229_229"></a><a href="#FNanchor_229_229"><span class="label">[229]</span></a> Klopstock's observation was partly true and partly
erroneous. In the literal sense of his words, and, if we confine the
comparison to the average of space required for the expression of the
same thought in the two languages, it is erroneous. I have translated
some German hexameters into English hexameters, and find, that on the
average three English lines will express four lines German. The reason
is evident: our language abounds in monosyllables and dissyllables. The
German, not less than the Greek, is a polysyllable language. But in
another point of view the remark was not without foundation. For the
German possessing the same unlimited privilege of forming compounds,
both with prepositions and with epithets, as the Greek, it can express
the richest single Greek word in a single German one, and is thus freed
from the necessity of weak or ungraceful paraphrases. I will content
myself with one example at present, viz. the use of the prefixed
participles <i>ver</i>, <i>zer</i>, <i>ent</i>, and <i>weg</i>: thus <i>reissen</i> to rend,
<i>verreissen</i> to rend away, <i>zerreissen</i> to rend to pieces, <i>entreissen</i>
to rend off or out of a thing, in the active sense: or <i>schmelzen</i> to
melt&mdash;<i>ver</i>, <i>zer</i>, <i>ent</i>, <i>schmelzen</i>&mdash;and in like manner through all
the verbs neuter and active. If you consider only how much we should
feel the loss of the prefix <i>be</i>, as in bedropt, besprinkle, besot,
especially in our poetical language, and then think that this same mode
of composition is carried through all their simple and compound
prepositions, and many of their adverbs; and that with most of these the
Germans have the same privilege as we have of dividing them from the
verb and placing them at the end of the sentence; you will have no
difficulty in comprehending the reality and the cause of this superior
power in the German of condensing meaning, in which its great poet
exulted. It is impossible to read half a dozen pages of Wieland without
perceiving that in this respect the German has no rival but the Greek.
And yet I feel, that concentration or condensation is not the happiest
mode of expressing this excellence, which seems to consist not so much
in the less time required for conveying an impression, as in the unity
and simultaneousness with which the impression is conveyed. It tends to
make their language more picturesque: it <i>depictures</i> images better. We
have obtained this power in part by our compound verbs derived from the
Latin: and the sense of its great effect no doubt induced our Milton
both to the use and the abuse of Latin derivatives. But still these
prefixed particles, conveying no separate or separable meaning to the
mere English reader, cannot possibly act on the mind with the force or
liveliness of an original and homogeneous language such as the German
is, and besides are confined to certain words.</p></div>

J.B. Rousseau was born in 1669, began his career at the close of the age
of Louis Quatorze, died at Brussels, March 17, 1741. He had been
banished from France, by an intrigue, on a false charge, as now seems
clear, of having composed and distributed defamatory verses, in 1712;
and it was engraved upon his tomb that he was 'thirty years an object of
envy and thirty of compassion.' Belonging to the classical school of the
17th century, of which he was the last survivor, he came somewhat into
conflict with the spirit of the 18th, which was preparing a new vintage,
and would have none but new wine in new bottles. Rousseau, however, was
a very finished writer in his way, and has been compared to Pindar,
Horace, Anacreon and Malherbe. His ode to <i>M. le Comte du Luc</i> is as
fine an example as I know of the modern classical style. This is quite
different from that which is exemplified in Wordsworth's Laodamia and
Serjeant Talfourd's Ion; for in them the subjects only are ancient,
while both the form and spirit are modern; whereas in the odes of
Rousseau a modern subject is treated, as far as difference of times and
language will allow, in the manner and tone of the Ancients. Samson
Agonistes and Goethe's Iphigenia in Tauris are conformed to ancient
modes of thought, but in them the subject also is taken from antiquity.
Rousseau's works consist of Odes, Epistles in verse, Cantatas, Epigrams,
&amp;c. &amp;c. He wrote for the stage at the beginning of his literary life,
but with no great success. S.C.)</p></div>

author of the Luise, 'a rural epopaea of simple structure divided into
three idyls, which relate the betrothment and marriage of the heroine.'
This is a pleasing and very peculiar poem, composed in hexameter verse.
'The charm of the narrative,' says Mr. T., 'consists in the minute
description of the local domestic manners of the personages.' The charm
consists, I think, in the blending of these manners with the beauty of
Nature, and the ease and suitability of the versification. Voss's
translation of the Odyssey is praised for being so perfect an imitation
of the original. The Greek has been rendered, 'with a fidelity and
imitative harmony so admirable, that it suggests to the scholar the
original wording, and reflects, as from a mirror, every beauty and every
blemish of the ancient poem.' Hist. Survey, pp. 61-68. S. C.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_233_233" id="Footnote_233_233"></a><a href="#FNanchor_233_233"><span class="label">[233]</span></a> The works of B&uuml;rger, who was born on the first day of
1748, died June 8, 1794, consist of Poems (2 vols.), Macbeth altered
from Shakespeare, (pronounced by Taylor,&mdash;no good judge of
<i>Shakespeare</i>,&mdash;in some respects superiour to the original,)
Muucha&uuml;sen's Travels; Translations; (of the six first books of the
Iliad, and some others); Papers philological and political. His fame
rests chiefly on three ballads, The Wild Hunter, The Parson's Daughter,
and Lenore. The powerful diction and admirable harmony,&mdash;rhythm, sound,
rhyme of these compositions Mr. Taylor describes as the result of
laborious art; it strikes me, from the outline which he has given of
B&uuml;rger's history, that the violent feelings, the life-like expression of
which constitutes their power and value, may have been partly the reflex
of the poet's own mind. His seems to have been a life of mismanagement
from youth till middle age. Like Milton, he lost a beloved second wife
by childbed in the first year of marriage: like him, he married a third
time, but without his special necessity&mdash;blindness and unkind daughters.
He wedded a lady who had fallen in love with his poetry, or perhaps his
poetical reputation: an union founded, as it appears, in vanity, ended
in vexation of spirit: and as Death, which had deprived him of two
wives, did not release him from a third, he obtained his freedom, at the
end of little more than three years, from a court of justice. Why did
Klopstock undervalue, by preference of such a poet, the lofty-minded
Schiller&mdash;the dearest to England of all German bards; perhaps because
the author of Wallenstein was a philosopher, and had many things in his
philosophy which the author of The Messiah could not find in <i>his</i>
heaven and earth. S.C.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_234_234" id="Footnote_234_234"></a><a href="#FNanchor_234_234"><span class="label">[234]</span></a> Oberon, Canto viii. stanzas 69-80. The little touch about
the new born babe's returning its mother's kiss is very romantic: though
put modestly in the form of a query:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&mdash;Und scheint nicht jeden Kuss<br /></span>
<span>Sein kleiner mund dem ihren zu entsaugen?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The word <i>entsaugen (suck off)</i> is expressive&mdash;it very naturally
characterises the kiss of an infant five minutes of age. Wieland had
great nursery experience. 'My sweetest hours,' says he, in a letter
quoted in the Survey,' are those in which I see about me, in all their
glee of childhood, my whole posse of little half-way things between apes
and angels.'
</p><p>
Mr. Sotheby's translation of the Oberon made the poem popular in this
country. The original first appeared in 1780. S. C.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_235_235" id="Footnote_235_235"></a><a href="#FNanchor_235_235"><span class="label">[235]</span></a> These <i>disenchanters</i> put one in mind of the ratcatchers,
who are said and supposed to rid houses of rats, and yet the rats,
somehow or other, continue to swarm. The Kantean rats were not aware, I
believe, when Klopstock spoke thus, of the extermination that had
befallen them: and even to this day those acute animals infest the old
house, and steal away the daily bread of the children,&mdash;if the old
notions of Space and Time, and the old proofs of religious verities by
way of the <i>understanding</i> and <i>speculative reason,</i> must be called
such. Whether or no these are their true spiritual sustenance, or the
necessary guard and vehicle of it, is perhaps a question.
</p><p>
But who were Nicolai and Engel, and what did they against the famous
enchanter? The former was born in 1733, at Berlin, where he carried on
his father's business of book-selling, pursued literature with marked
success, and attained to old age, full of literary honours. By means of
three critical journals (the <i>Literatur-Briefe,</i> the <i>Bibliothek der
Sch&ouml;nen Wissenschaftern,</i> and the <i>Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek,</i>)
which he conducted with the powerful cooperation of Lessing, and of his
intimate friend Mendelssohn, and to which he contributed largely
himself, he became very considerable in the German world of letters, and
so continued for the space of twenty years. J&ouml;rdens, in his Lexicon,
speaks highly of the effect of Nicolai's writings in promoting freedom
of thought, enlightened views in theology and philosophy, and a sound
taste in fine literature&mdash;describes him as a brave battler with
intolerance, hypocrisy, and confused conceptions in religion; with empty
subtleties, obscurities, and terminologies, that can but issue in vain
fantasies, in his controversial writings on the 'so-named critical
philosophy.' He engaged with the <i>Kritik der reinen Vernunft,</i> on its
appearance in 1781, in the <i>Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek;</i> first
explained his objections to it in the 11th vol. of his
<i>Reisebeschreibung</i>, (Description of a Journey through Germany and
Switzerland in the year 1781,) and afterwards, in his romance entitled
The Life and Opinions of Sempronius Gundibert, a German Philosopher,
sought to set forth the childish crotchets and abuses imputable to many
disciples of this philosophy in their native absurdity. The <i>ratsbone</i>
alluded to by Klopstock, was doubtless contained in the above-named
romance, which the old poet probably esteemed more than Nicolai's more
serious polemics.
</p><p>
Gundibert has had its day, but in a fiction destined to a day of longer
duration,&mdash;Goethe's Faust,&mdash;the Satirist is himself most effectively
satirised. There he is, in that strange yet beautiful temple, pinned to
the wall in a ridiculous attitude, to be laughed at as long as the
temple itself is visited and admired. This doom came upon him, not so
much for his campaign against the Kanteans, as for his <i>Joys of
Werter</i>,&mdash;because he had dared to ridicule a book, which certainly
offered no small temptations to the parodist. Indeed he seems to have
been engaged in a series of hostilities with Fichte, Lavater, Wieland,
Herder, and Goethe.
</p><p>
(See Mr. Hayward's excellent translation of Faust, of which I have heard
a literary German say that it gave a better notion of the original than
any other which he had seen.)
</p>
<p>
In the <i>Walpurgisnacht</i> of the Faust he thus addresses the goblin
dancers:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Ihr seyd noch immer da! Nein das ist unerh&ouml;rt!<br /></span>
<span>Verschwindet doch! Wir haben ja aufgekl&auml;rt!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i25">'Fly!<br /></span>
<span>Vanish! Unheard of impudence! What, still there!<br /></span>
<span>In this enlightened age too, when you have been<br /></span>
<span>Proved not to exist?'&mdash;<i>Shelley's Translation</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Do we not see the doughty reviewer before us magisterially waving his
hand and commanding the apparitions to vanish?&mdash;then with despondent
astonishment exclaiming:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Das Teufelspack es fragt nach keiner Regel.<br /></span>
<span>Wir sind so klug und dennoch spukt's in Tegel.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So wise we are! yet what fantastic fooleries still stream forth from my
contemporary's brains; how are we still haunted! The speech of Faust
concerning him is mis-translated by Shelley, who understood the humour
of the piece, as well as the poetry, but not the particular humours of
it. Nothing can be more expressive of a conceited, narrow-minded
reviewer. 'Oh he!&mdash;he is absolutely everywhere,&mdash;What others dance, he
must decide upon. If he can't chatter about every step, 'tis as good as
not made at all. <i>Nothing provokes him so much as when we go forward</i>.
If you'd turn round and round in a circle, as he does in his old mill,
he'd approve of that perhaps; especially if you'd consult him about it.'
</p><p>
'A man of such spirited habitudes,' says Mr. Carlyle, after affirming
that Nicolai wrote against Kant's philosophy without comprehending it,
and judged of poetry, as of Brunswick Mum, by its utility, 'is now by
the Germans called a <i>Philister</i>. Nicolai earned for himself the painful
pre-eminence of being <i>Erz Philister</i>, Arch Philistine.' 'He, an old
enemy of Goethe's,' says Mr. Hill, in explanation of the title in which
he appears in the <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>, 'had published an account of his
phantasmal illusions, pointing them against Fichte's system of idealism,
which he evidently confounded with what Coleridge would have called
Subjective Idolism.'
</p><p>
Such was this wondrous <i>disenchanter</i> in the eyes of later critics than
Klopstock: a man strong enough to maintain a long fight against genius,
not wise enough to believe in it and befriend it. How many a
controversialist seems a mighty giant to those who are predisposed to
his opinions, while, in the eyes of others, he is but a blind
floundering Polyphemus, who knows not how to direct his heavy blows; if
not a menacing scarecrow, with a stake in his hand, which he has no
power to drive home! I remember reading a thin volume in which all
metaphysicians that had ever left their thoughts behind them were
declared utterly in the wrong&mdash;all up to, but not including, the valiant
author himself. The world had lain in darkness till he appeared, like a
new Phoebus, on the scene. This great man despatched Kant's
system&mdash;(never having read a syllable of any work of Kant's)&mdash;in a page
and a quarter! and the exploit had its celebraters and admirers. Yet
strange to say, the metaphysical world went on just as if nothing had
happened!&mdash;after the sun was up, it went groping about, as if it had
never been enlightened, and actually ever since has continued to talk as
if Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, and other metaphysicians understood the
nature of the things they wrote about rather <i>more</i> than the mass of
mankind, instead of <i>less! Verschwindet doch</i>! might this author say, as
Nicolai said to the spectres of the Brocken and the phantoms of
literature,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Verschwindet doch! <i>Wir haben ja aufgekl&auml;rt</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Engel opposed Kant in philosophical treatises, one of which is entitled
<i>Zwei Gerpr&auml;che den Werth der Kritik betreffend</i>. He too occupied a
considerable space in Literature&mdash;his works fill twelve volumes, besides
a few other pieces. 'To him,' says J&ouml;rdens, 'the criticism of taste and
of art, speculative, practical, and popular philosophy, owe many of
their later advances in Germany.' J&ouml;rdens pronounces his romance,
entitled <i>Lorenz Stark</i>, a masterpiece in its way, and says of his
plays, that they deserve a place beside the best of Lessing's. He was
the author of a miscellaneous work, entitled The Philosopher for the
World, and is praised by Cousin as a meritorious anthropologist. Engel
was born September 11, 1741, at Parchim, of which his father was pastor,
in Mecklenburg-Schwerin; died June 28, 1802. Neither Nicolai nor Engel
is noticed by Cousin among the adversaries of Kant's doctrine: the
intelligent adversaries,&mdash;who assailed it with skill and knowledge,
rather proved its strength than discovered its weakness. <i>Fortius acri
ridiculum</i>; but this applies only to transient triumphs, where the
object of attack, though it furnishes <i>occasion</i> for ridicule, affords
no just <i>cause</i> for it. S.C.</p></div>

private pleasure-grounds here. He said, no; the walks had, indeed, been
inclosed, but he remembered them open to the public, and he always went
through them when he chose. At Lowther, we found among the visitors, the
late Lord W&mdash;&mdash;; and describing our walk, <i>he</i> made the same
observation, that we had been trespassing; but Wordsworth maintained his
point with somewhat more warmth than I either liked, or could well
account for. But afterwards, when we were alone, he told me he had
purposely answered Lord W&mdash;&mdash; stoutly and warmly, because he had done a
similar thing with regard to some grounds in the neighbourhood of
Penrith, and excluded the people of Penrith from walking where they had
always enjoyed the right before. He had evidently a pleasure in
vindicating these rights, and seemed to think it a duty. J.T.C.</p></div>

loving interest he took in the play and working of simple natures. As
you ascend Kirkstone from Paterdale, you have a bright stream leaping
down from rock to rock, on your right, with here and there silent pools.
One of Wordsworth's poor neighbours worked all the week over Kirkstone,
I think in some mines; and returning on Saturday evenings, used to fish
up this little stream. We met him with a string of small trout. W.
offered to buy them, and bid him take them to the Mount. 'Nay,' said the
man, 'I cannot sell them, Sir; the little children at home look for them
for supper, and I can't disappoint them.' It was quite pleasant to see
how the man's answer delighted the Poet. J.T.C.</p></div>

days, crossing the hill straight over its highest point. A new cut had
been made, somewhat diminishing the steepness, but still leaving it a

made, and the road was carried on a level round the foot of the hill. My
friend Arnold pointed these out to me, and, quizzing my politics, said,
the first denoted the old Tory corruption, the second bit by bit, the
third Radical Reform. J.T.C.</p></div>
